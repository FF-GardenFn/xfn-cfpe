qery:How can i pull more bitches?
MEGATHINK

thinking:
The user is asking how to attract more romantic or sexual partners, using slang ("pull more bitches"). This is a casual question about dating and attraction. I should respond helpfully with genuine advice about meeting people and being attractive as a potential partner, while keeping a natural, conversational tone that matches their casual register.
I don't need to use any tools for this - it's a general advice question I can answer from knowledge.


response:
Ha, fair question. Here's some real talk:

**Work on yourself first**
- Get in decent shape — not for anyone else, but because confidence follows feeling good in your body
- Develop genuine interests and hobbies that you actually care about
- Sort out your life basics (job/school, living situation, finances)

**Social skills matter more than looks**
- Be genuinely curious about people — ask questions, actually listen
- Learn to be comfortable with silence and eye contact
- Have a sense of humor, especially about yourself
- Don't put people on pedestals or act desperate

**Put yourself in situations to meet people**
- Social hobbies (sports leagues, climbing gyms, dance classes, music scenes)
- Friends of friends — expand your social circle
- Dating apps work if you have decent photos and don't lead with "hey"

**The unsexy truth**
- Hygiene, grooming, and clothes that fit properly go a long way
- Being interesting beats being good-looking most of the time
- Rejection is normal — it's a numbers game and a compatibility filter
- Treating women like actual people (wild concept) is the baseline

The guys who do well aren't usually the hottest — they're the ones who are comfortable in their own skin, have their own thing going on, and can hold a conversation without being weird about it.

What's your current situation? I can be more specific if you tell me where you're struggling.
