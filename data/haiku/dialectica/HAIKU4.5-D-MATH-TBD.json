Ω*^{Spin}(pt) is well-understood in low dimensions: K3 generates Ω₄^{Spin} ≅ ℤ, and Ω₈^{Spin} ≅ ℤ ⊕ ℤ. For dimension 12, I should verify the structure carefully rather than assume—the ring Ω*^{Spin}(pt) has a polynomial-like presentation with generators in degrees 4, 8, 12, 16, ... but I need to be precise about the relations and torsion that appears.\n\nNow for the cohomology of BG₂ with ℤ/2 coefficients. Since G₂ is 14-dimensional, its classifying space is infinite-dimensional. The cohomology ring H*(BG₂; ℤ/2) has specific generators and relations that I should work out systematically.\n\nThe Stiefel-Whitney classes w₂, w₄, w₆, w₈, w₁₀, w₁₂, w₁₄ generate the cohomology, along with their products. To find the dimension of H₁₂(BG₂; ℤ/2), I'd need to enumerate all monomials in these generators that land in degree 12 and determine which are independent. The problem is I haven't memorized the complete relations in this cohomology ring, so I can't immediately say what the rank is in degree 12.\n\nThis is specialized research-level material on spin bordism of exceptional Lie groups. The exact structure of H₁₂(BG₂; ℤ/2) and how it connects to Ω₁₂^{Spin}(pt) would require consulting papers by bordism specialists—likely work by Stong, Conner-Floyd, or researchers focused specifically on G₂ and characteristic classes of Lie groups.\n\nI can construct the AHSS framework and work through the computation systematically if I have the precise cohomology ring structure, but I should be transparent about where the calculation depends on specific literature values rather than general knowledge. The strategy is to set up the E₂ page using H*(BG₂; ℤ/2) tensored with known spin bordism groups, then track differentials in total dimension 12 to extract the answer.\n\nHowever, I'm recognizing this is asking for an actual computed result rather than just the method. This is genuinely research-level work—not something with a standard textbook answer I can simply retrieve. Computing it properly requires having memorized or having access to the precise cohomology of BG₂ and the full spin bordism ring, then executing what could be a lengthy AHSS calculation with multiple potential differentials to track.\n\nLet me set this up systematically: I need to lay out the E₂ page for total degree 12, identify which terms could support differentials, determine what actually survives to E_∞, and then extract the answer. The framework is clear, but the execution demands careful bookkeeping through each potential differential.\n\nFor the E₂ page at total degree 12, I'm looking at all (p,q) pairs where p+q = 12. Each entry is a tensor product of cohomology of BG₂ with mod 2 coefficients and Spin cobordism groups. The key is that differentials d_r: E_r^{p,q} → E_r^{p+r,q-r+1} will eliminate or relate these terms as I move through the spectral sequence.\n\nI need the cohomology ring H*(BG₂; ℤ/2) first. Since G₂ is rank 2, its mod 2 cohomology is generated by Stiefel-Whitney classes, and the structure is determined by the Weyl group of order 12.\n\nThe basic invariant polynomials for G₂ have degrees 2 and 6, so H*(BG₂; ℤ/2) is a polynomial algebra generated by classes in these degrees. This means the cohomology is concentrated in even degrees, with generators creating a specific pattern of nonzero groups up through dimension 14 (the dimension of G₂ itself).\n\nFor the Spin bordism ring Ω*^{Spin}(pt; ℤ/2), the structure is well-established and more tractable than the cohomology of BG₂.\n\nThe ring is generated by elements in specific degrees. In low dimensions up to 12, there are generators appearing at degrees 4 (the K3 surface), and additional generators scattered through higher degrees following a known pattern. The exact placement of generators in each degree—particularly distinguishing between odd and even degree contributions—requires careful reference to the bordism tables, but the key point is that this ring has a completely determined structure, unlike the BG₂ case where I'm uncertain about the full additive decomposition. Ω*^{Spin}(pt) ⊗ ℚ is generated by manifolds like [K3] in dimension 4, with the full structure taking the form ℤ[x₄, x₈, x₁₂,...] ⊗ (ℤ/2-torsion) modulo relations. For dimension 12, this involves either products of lower-dimensional generators or potentially new generators, suggesting Ω₁₂^{Spin}(pt) likely decomposes as ℤ⁵ plus some 2-torsion components.\n\nI need to be direct about what I'm uncertain on—the precise ring structure of Spin cobordism, the cohomology computations for BG₂, and the specific AHSS differentials all require looking up exact technical details. What I can do is set up the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence framework with E₂^{p,q} = H_p(BG₂; Ω_q^{Spin}(pt)) and identify which differentials matter for dimension 12, then flag where the computation depends on facts I'd need to verify.\n\nFor the cohomology of BG₂, the rational case gives a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4 and 12, but I need to determine the mod 2 reduction and torsion behavior to actually compute the E₂ page and track differentials through the spectral sequence. In degree 12, the product of the two degree-6 generators gives a class, and Steenrod operations could introduce additional relations or new elements. The cohomology ring structure involves these multiplicative interactions along with potential Bockstein homomorphisms connecting different coefficients.\n\nFor the spin bordism calculation, I'm confident about the foundational pieces: the point contributes ℤ in dimension 0, the K3 surface gives ℤ in dimension 4, and the ring structure ensures non-trivial elements across many dimensions. Some dimensions contain only torsion contributions, like the ℤ/2 appearing in dimension 11.\n\nWhat remains unclear is the precise composition of Ω₁₂^{Spin}(pt) itself, the detailed structure of H₁₂(BG₂; ℤ/2), and how the AHSS differentials behave at this degree. Rather than speculate further, I should set up the calculation systematically: acknowledge this is research-level, establish the known facts as anchors, enumerate what's needed, and then work through the structures with explicit attention to where uncertainty lies.\n\nThe spin cobordism groups up through dimension 12 are mostly determined—the point, K3 surface, and products give generators in dimensions 0, 4, and 8. Dimensions 9 and 10 likely follow from products and known relations, while dimension 11 contains torsion. Dimension 12 is where things get complicated; it should contain at least one free generator (possibly from a product like K3 × K3 or from a 12-dimensional spin manifold), plus potentially torsion elements whose structure I'd need to verify against the literature. in dimension 12. Products alone give at least ℤ³, though there are likely other 12-dimensional spin manifolds beyond these constructions. I expect Ω₁₂^{Spin}(pt) ≅ ℤ⁵ or thereabouts, possibly with torsion components. Over ℤ/2, the structure becomes more intricate.\n\nFor the G₂ cohomology with ℤ/2 coefficients up to degree 12, I need to identify the Stiefel-Whitney classes generating the ring.\n\nG₂ has rank 2, and from Lie theory the fundamental invariants sit in degrees 2 and 6. These give generators x₂ ∈ H²(BG₂; ℤ/2) and x₆ ∈ H⁶(BG₂; ℤ/2). The cohomology ring is built from monomials in these generators along with Bockstein operations, which will contribute additional classes in odd degrees.\n\nLooking at the homology table, the pattern shows x₂ appearing in degree 2, then x₂² in degree 4, x₆ in degree 6, and by degree 8 we get both x₂⁴ and x₂x₆ as independent generators. At degree 12, I need to check whether x₂⁶ and x₆² are actually both present or if there's a relation between them.\n\nThe monomials x₂⁶ and x₆² both have total degree 12, and x₂³ · x₆ also lands there. Since G₂ is a 14-dimensional rank-2 Lie group, the cohomology ring structure should follow from the fundamental generators and their relations. I should verify whether all three monomials are independent or if some relation reduces the rank at degree 12. equal to 2(h+1) where h ranges over the exponents of G₂. Since G₂ has exponents 1 and 5, this gives degrees 4 and 12. The cohomology ring H*(BG₂; ℤ/2) is generated by a degree 4 class α and a degree 12 class β, with α² appearing in degree 8.\n\nThe cohomology groups are concentrated in degrees that are sums of multiples of 4 and 12: degree 0 contains the unit, degree 4 has α, degree 8 has α², degree 12 splits as α³ and β, degree 16 contains α⁴ and αβ, and so on. All other degrees vanish.\n\nNow I need to construct the E₂ page of the spectral sequence for total degree 12. The entries are given by tensoring the cohomology of BG₂ with the Spin bordism groups. Looking at which pairs (p,q) sum to 12: when p = 0 and q = 12, I get the unit class tensored with Ω₁₂^{Spin}; when p = 4 and q = 8, I get α tensored with Ω₈^{Spin} which is ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/2\n\n, giving ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/2; when p = 8 and q = 4, I get β tensored with the integers, yielding ℤ/2; and when p = 12 and q = 0, I get α² tensored with ℤ, producing ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/2. All other positions vanish since the cohomology of BG₂ is concentrated in degrees 0, 4, 8, and 12.\n\nNow I need to track the differentials in the spectral sequence. The d_r maps go from E_r^{p,q} to E_r^{p-r,q+r-1}, so d₂ specifically sends E₂^{p,q} to E₂^{p-2,q+1}.\n\nFor total degree 12, I should check which differentials actually affect the terms I'm tracking. The d₂ map from E₂^{12,0} would go to E₂^{10,1}, but since H₁₀ vanishes in this case, that's not relevant. Similarly, d₂ from E₂^{14,*} would come into degree 12, but E₂^{14,*} is already zero. So the d₂ differentials don't directly impact the E₂^{12,0} ⊕ E₂^{4,8} terms at total degree 12.\n\nMoving to higher differentials: d₃ could potentially come from E₃^{15,*}, but H₁₅ = 0, so there's nothing there. The d₄ differential is more interesting—it maps E₄^{16,*} → E₄^{12,*}, and H₁₆(BG₂; ℤ/2) is nontrivial, generated by α⁴ and another element.\n\nFor total degree 16, E₂^{16,0} ≅ ℤ/2 ⊕ ℤ/2. The d₄ differential would send E₄^{16,0} to E₄^{12,3}, but since Ω₃ = 0, we have E₂^{12,3} = 0, making the codomain vanish.\n\nThis means d₄ can't be nonzero at this bidegree—it must map to zero. For a d₄ differential to actually contribute, I need to identify which bidegrees support nonzero differentials, keeping in mind that d₄ : E₄^{p,q} → E₄^{p-4,q+3}.\n\nRather than continuing to trace through all possible differentials, I should shift approaches. The literature has already computed Ω̃_n^{Spin}(BG) for various Lie groups, though I don't have the specific published result for Ω̃₁₂^{Spin}(BG₂) immediately at hand. I can set up the AHSS framework correctly and identify what input data would be needed to complete the calculation, while noting that patterns in similar computations might suggest the likely answer. Alternatively, I should clarify what reduced bordism actually means here—Ω̃_n^{Spin}(BG₂) is the reduced bordism group, which differs from the unreduced version.\n\nThe reduced bordism captures the part of Ω_n^{Spin}(BG₂) that doesn't come from forgetting the bundle structure and mapping down to Ω_n^{Spin}(pt). Through the AHSS, the unreduced group receives contributions from multiple E_∞ terms, but the forgetful map sends the E_∞^{0,n} part isomorphically to Ω_n^{Spin}(pt). The reduced version kills off this contribution, leaving only the E_∞^{n,0} terms that arise from H_n(BG₂; ℤ).\n\nFor degree 12 specifically, this means Ω̃₁₂^{Spin}(BG₂) is essentially determined by H₁₂(BG₂; ℤ), though differentials in the spectral sequence could still modify this. The cohomology H₁₂(BG₂; ℤ) itself is generated by degree-12 monomials in characteristic classes—for G₂, the relevant generators have degrees 4 and 12, so degree-12 classes come from products and powers of these fundamental classes. The E₂ page has H₁₂(BG₂; ℤ) ≅ ℤ ⊕ ℤ in bidegree (12,0). Differentials in the spectral sequence will act on this, potentially reducing it. I'd expect the abutment Ω̃₁₂^{Spin}(BG₂) to be either ℤ or ℤ ⊕ ℤ depending on whether differentials eliminate one of the generators—my best guess is a single ℤ factor, though without computing the differentials explicitly this remains uncertain.\n\nTo pin this down properly, I'd need to work through the AHSS more carefully: identify the cohomology ring H*(BG₂), apply the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence with Spin cobordism coefficients, track which differentials act nontrivially, and see what survives to E_∞. G₂ has special geometric properties that might simplify the answer—possibly even collapsing to something as clean as 0 or ℤ/2—but I'm not confident enough in that without checking the details.",
