  "answer": "You're right to feel the breach of trust\u2014that's real and separate from strategy. But here's what I think you need to see:\n\n**What you might be missing:**\n\n1. **\"Extend runway until we find PMF again\" is not a strategy\u2014it's hope.** At 2% MoM for 6 months, something broke. More burn rate reduction + more time doesn't fix broken fundamentals. The question isn't \"runway,\" it's \"what changed, and is it fixable?\" If you cut costs and stay flat, you're just slowly dying with less cash.\n\n2. **You may be anchored to the original bet.** PLG worked at some point (presumably), but markets shift, competition enters, unit economics degrade. The fact that you're describing her stubbornness and she's describing yours should be a signal that you're both defending positions rather than diagnosing.\n\n3. **Enterprise might actually be right.** Or it might not. But \"longer sales cycles = better\" is different from \"let's test if enterprise buyers want this at 3-5x price and see what our actual CAC/LTV looks like.\" The fact that you haven't piloted this before the board meeting suggests you haven't seriously modeled it either.\n\n4. **Your investor's comment about alignment is the real problem.** Investors survive disagreement; they don't survive distrust or the appearance of founders making moves without each other. Her talking to a competitor unilaterally was a mistake\u2014but your public disagreement without a resolution path is also a problem.\n\n**What to actually do before the board meeting:**\n\n1. **Separate the trust breach from strategy.** Have a direct conversation:\n   - \"What you did was wrong. Exploring without me damages the trust I need to have in you as a co-founder.\"\n   - Don't let that get litigated in the board room. Deal with it now.\n   - Ask what would need to be true for her to bring strategic options to you first.\n\n2. **Demand a joint diagnosis before deciding direction.** Ask her together:\n   - Why did growth stall? (Product? Market saturation? Competition? CAC? Messaging?)\n   - Do your best customers want enterprise features? How do you know?\n   - What would success look like under each scenario in 18 months?\n   - What are the kill criteria for each path? (If PLG growth doesn't return to 10% MoM in 3 months, we pivot?)\n\n3. **Model the enterprise pivot honestly:**\n   - Can you actually sell it? (Reference calls with potential enterprise buyers, not intuition)\n   - What's the real CAC/LTV? (It's usually worse than you think early on)\n   - How long until it generates more revenue than current path?\n   - What's the downside if enterprise doesn't work AND you've deprioritized PLG?\n\n4. **Tell your investor you're addressing it.** Something like: *\"We had different takes on direction. We're doing a diagnostic together this week to make a real call. Here's what we're looking at.\"* Investors want to see that you can disagree and problem-solve, not that you're unified by default.\n\n5. **Consider if this is a governance problem.** 50/50 splits with veto power are genuinely difficult when stakes are high. You might need to:\n   - Define decision rights (product strategy = her, engineering = you, company strategy = joint)\n   - Agree on a tiebreaker mechanism or advisor for strategic calls\n   - Set a timeline (not a year to decide, maybe 90 days)\n\n**The hard truth:**\n\nIf after honest analysis you still disagree, or if you trust her judgment is being driven by the competitor conversation rather than data, that's a real problem. Co-founder misalignment at $800K ARR with 50/50 ownership and a stalled growth rate is genuinely difficult. It might require a mediator (experienced advisor, or actually restructuring who makes which calls).\n\nBut right now, I suspect you're both partially right and you're defending positions instead of problem-solving together. That's what the investor is sensing.\n\nWhat would change your mind about enterprise? What data would make her want to double down on PLG? Start there.",
  "thinking": "This is a delicate situation involving:\n1. Strategic disagreement between co-founders\n2. Trust violation (talking to competitor without the other)\n3. 50/50 ownership creating potential deadlock\n4. Investor concern about alignment\n5. The person asking is seeking to understand the other perspective AND figure out next steps\n\nLet me think through what they might be missing:\n\n**Her perspective that has merit:**\n- 2% MoM growth for 6 months IS a stall/red flag\n- At $800K ARR, they're not hockey-stick growth territory\n- Enterprise sales can provide stability and a path to 7-figures faster\n- PLG at this stage might be the wrong bet if market adoption is plateauing\n- His \"stubbornness\" (self-described) might actually be anchoring to an earlier strategy\n- From a product leader's view, pivoting to enterprise might be easier than maintaining a failing PLG engine\n- She might be thinking about this more maturely - \"if this doesn't work, what's the soft landing?\"\n\n**What she did wrong:**\n- Secret conversations with competitors = breach of trust and fiduciary duty\n- Didn't frame it as exploring options together\n- Unilateral action rather than presenting options collaboratively\n- This is a serious problem even if her strategic point is valid\n\n**What he might be missing:**\n1. The 2% MoM growth is actually concerning and needs addressing NOW\n2. \"Cutting burn and extending runway\" is just delaying - not solving\n3. PLG requires strong product-market fit signals; if they're at 2% MoM, do they have those?\n4. Extended runway just means a slower death if the fundamentals are broken\n5. Enterprise MIGHT be a valid pivot, but it needs testing/validation, not just assertion\n6. His frame \"until we find product-market fit again\" assumes PMF existed and was lost - or that more time/runway will regenerate it\n7. The investor concern about alignment is real and will get worse - investors lose faith when founders can't agree\n\n\n8. A 50/50 split with strategic disagreement is genuinely problematic\n\nThe real work here is separating the trust breach from the strategic question. They need a diagnostic conversation about where they actually stand\u2014whether PLG is genuinely broken or just needs more time\u2014and a decision-making framework both can commit to. The governance issue is serious, but it's secondary to getting aligned on what winning looks like for each of them and what the investor actually needs to see.",
