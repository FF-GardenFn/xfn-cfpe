  "answer": "The reflector's design property that created vulnerability: **no letter could ever encrypt to itself**.\n\nBecause the reflector paired letters (A\u2194B, C\u2194D, etc.) and current flowed through it before returning through the rotors, the output letter was always different from the input letter.\n\n**Why this mattered for cryptanalysis:**\n\n1. **Crib-based attacks**: When Allied cryptanalysts had a suspected plaintext (\"crib\"), they could eliminate any rotor position where a ciphertext letter aligned with the same plaintext letter. This drastically reduced the search space.\n\n2. **The Bombe's efficiency**: Turing's Bombe exploited this by testing cribs against ciphertext\u2014any position producing a letter encrypting to itself was immediately discarded.\n\n3. **Statistical signature**: In normal language, letters occasionally repeat in the same position across related messages. The guaranteed absence of self-encryption was a detectable anomaly.\n\n**Confidence**: 0.85 (factual retrieval from well-documented cryptographic history)",
