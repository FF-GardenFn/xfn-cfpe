  "answer": "**The Diagnosis**\n\n**Compound problem masquerading as statistical question.** The debate between CPO and data scientist is a proxy war over decision rules, not evidence interpretation. Both are technically correct within their frames: the CI *is* mostly positive; p *is* > 0.05. The real question isn't \"what does the data say\" but \"what decision rule applies to this type of decision.\"\n\nThree distinct problems entangled:\n1. **Statistical inference** (what do we know?)\n2. **Decision under uncertainty** (what should we do given what we know?)\n3. **Career risk management** (what serves your interests?)\n\nThese have different optimal solutions. The CPO is solving #2 with expected value logic. The data scientist is solving #1 with frequentist methodology. You're quietly solving #3 while framing it as #1.\n\n---\n\n## The Framework\n\n**Reframe the statistical question first.** The 0.05 threshold is a social convention, not a law of physics. It answers: \"Would we be embarrassed publishing this?\" That's wrong frame for business decisions.\n\nThe correct question: **What's the expected value of each action given our uncertainty?**\n\n```\n                    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                    \u2502     DECISION TREE                       \u2502\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                                      \u2502\n                    \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                    \u25bc                                   \u25bc\n               SHIP NOW                            WAIT 2 WEEKS\n                    \u2502                                   \u2502\n         \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510               \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n         \u25bc                   \u25bc               \u25bc                   \u25bc\n    Uplift Real         Uplift Null     Confirms Real      Confirms Null\n    (p \u2248 0.55)          (p \u2248 0.45)      (p \u2248 0.55)         (p \u2248 0.45)\n         \u2502                   \u2502               \u2502                   \u2502\n    +$180K/yr            +$0/yr          +$180K/yr             $0\n    -$40K/yr             -$40K/yr        -$40K/yr              $0\n    =$140K net           =-$40K          -Sprint delay     -Sprint delay\n                                         =$140K net            $0\n```\n\n**Expected value calculation:**\n\n*Ship now:*\n- P(real) \u00d7 $140K + P(null) \u00d7 -$40K\n- Using Bayesian posterior from this data: ~55% real, ~45% null\n- EV = 0.55 \u00d7 $140K + 0.45 \u00d7 -$40K = **$77K - $18K = +$59K/year**\n\n*Wait 2 weeks:*\n- Same expected final value but delayed 2 weeks + sprint cost\n- Sprint delay cost: depends on roadmap value, but let's call it $X\n- EV = +$59K - $X - (2 weeks revenue opportunity cost \u2248 $5K)\n\n**On pure expected value, ship now wins** unless sprint delay costs >$54K in opportunity.\n\n---\n\n**Path 1: Ship Now**\n- *Governing logic*: Expected value positive; technical debt cost already factored\n- *Best if*: Uplift real, or even if null\u2014decision was correct given information\n- *Fails if*: Uplift strongly negative (which data rules out\u2014CI floor is -1.2%)\n\n**Path 2: Wait for Significance**\n- *Governing logic*: Avoid false positive; maintain statistical rigor standards\n- *Best if*: Company culture punishes Type I errors severely; you need political cover\n- *Fails if*: Competitor ships similar, or roadmap delay costs exceed uncertainty reduction value\n\n**Path 3: Ship with Kill Switch** *(dominant path)*\n- *Governing logic*: Capture expected value while maintaining option to reverse\n- *Implementation*: Ship as feature flag, commit to 4-week review with pre-registered reversal threshold\n- *Best if*: Most realistic uncertainty scenarios\n- *Fails if*: Technical debt from flagging exceeds clean implementation\n\n---\n\n## The Hidden Problem\n\nYour personal stakes section reveals the actual crux: **you're optimizing for credit attribution, not business value.**\n\nNotice what you didn't ask: \"What's best for the company?\" You asked \"Ship or wait?\"\u2014a frame that preserves your ownership of the outcome either way.\n\nThe honest decomposition:\n\n| Scenario | Ship Now | Wait |\n|----------|----------|------|\n| Uplift real + you ship | Big win | Smaller win (delayed) |\n| Uplift null + you ship | Moderate loss (visible mistake) | Avoided loss |\n| Competitor ships first | You lose credit | You lose credit |\n\nYour risk is asymmetric: **the null outcome hurts you more if you ship**. The company's risk is symmetric. You're asking which frame to adopt to make \"ship\" feel justified, because shipping serves your timeline.\n\nThis isn't wrong\u2014career management is legitimate\u2014but it should be explicit, not hidden behind statistical debates.\n\n---\n\n## Load-Bearing Question\n\n**Is the technical debt reversible, and at what cost?**\n\n- If reversible cheaply (<$10K): Ship now, monitor, reverse if needed\n- If irreversible: Wait, because you're buying a permanent asset with uncertain value\n- If engineering says \"forever\"\u2014challenge that. Most \"permanent\" decisions aren't.\n\nSecondary: **What's the sprint delay actually worth?** \"Delays Q1 roadmap\" is not a number. Convert to expected revenue impact.\n\n---\n\n## Epistemic Status\n\n**Framework confidence: 0.75**\n- Correctly decomposed statistical vs. decision vs. career problems\n- Expected value math is sound given assumptions\n- \u22120.05: Prior probability estimate (55/45) is approximate\n- \u22120.05: Sprint delay cost not quantified\n\n**Prediction confidence: 0.60**\n- Dominant path (ship with kill switch) is robust across scenarios\n- \u22120.10: Technical reversibility is key unknown\n- \u22120.05: Career dynamics are inferred, not stated explicitly\n\n**Reliability**: Medium \u2014 depends on accurate cost estimates\n**Fragility**: Anti-fragile \u2014 Path 3 degrades gracefully to either Path 1 or 2\n\n**Key assumption**: Technical debt is not truly permanent; feature flags are feasible\n**Falsification**: If engineering confirms irreversibility with specifics, framework shifts toward \"wait\"\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Mortem\n\n**If this fails, most likely cause:** The 15% uplift was real but unstable\u2014driven by novelty effect that decays. You shipped, celebrated, then watched conversion regress over 8 weeks while carrying the technical debt.\n\n**Early warning:** Week-over-week conversion trend in first month. If it's declining, novelty effect likely.\n\n**Assumption most likely wrong:** That the current CI accurately captures the true effect. Two weeks of data has high variance; true effect could be anywhere in that wide range. The *center* of your estimate is probably off by more than you think.\n\n---\n\n## The Direct Answer\n\n**Ship with a kill switch and a pre-registered decision rule.**\n\n1. Deploy behind feature flag (renegotiate \"forever\" with engineering\u2014flags are temporary by design)\n2. Set calendar reminder: 4 weeks from now, review with pre-committed threshold\n3. If 4-week cumulative p < 0.10: keep permanently\n4. If 4-week cumulative p > 0.20: revert\n5. If between: extend another 2 weeks\n\nThis captures the expected value, maintains reversibility, and\u2014critically\u2014**gives you a defensible process regardless of outcome**. \"We shipped with monitoring and predetermined reversal criteria\" is credible whether it succeeds or fails. \"We shipped because I pushed for it\" is not.\n\nThe CPO's intuition is correct (positive EV). The data scientist's concern is valid (uncertainty is real). The synthesis is: **act on positive EV, but preserve optionality.** That's what sophisticated decision-making under uncertainty looks like.",
