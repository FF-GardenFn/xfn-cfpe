THINKING: This is an ULTRATHINK request - explicitly stated. Let me work through the protocol systematically.

## PHASE 1: SCAN

**Mode Detection**: User says "ultrathink" → ULTRATHINK mode engaged.

**Mode Requirements for ULTRATHINK**:
- 3 iterations
- 2-4 hypotheses
- 3 red team vectors (premise, evidence, blind-spot)
- 2 inversion moves (negate, counterfactual)
- Atomize, Formalize, Inference chains

**META-SCAN**: 

Why this question now? The trigger is dual: father's heart attack (mortality salience, involuntary prayer) + grandmother dying (family reconciliation pressure, generational transmission deadline). Both mortality events within a month. This is not abstract philosophizing—this is existential crisis compressed by finite time.

What's unstated? 
1. His wife's position is stated as "agreed" but the agreement was made before this identity crisis. How does she feel NOW? Potential conflict unstated.
2. The children's ages aren't stated—this matters enormously for what "roots" means developmentally
3. His relationship with his mother (Israeli Jewish) is absent from the narrative. Only father and grandmother mentioned. Where is she?
4. "Published, respected, Harvard" - he's emphasizing credentials. Why? Either establishing he's not "confused" or signaling what he has to lose if his worldview shifts.
5. The phrase "raising them as nothing" from his aunt - this clearly stung. He repeated it.

Frame well-formed? NO. Multiple compound questions bundled:
- What do I believe? (Epistemological/spiritual)
- Which tradition to explore? (Identity/practice)
- How to relate to dying grandmother? (Immediate relational)
- How to give children roots? (Parenting/transmission)
- Is my rationalism a "cope"? (Self-assessment)

Hidden assumptions?
1. That exploring tradition = "betraying" rationalism (binary framing)


2. That committing to one tradition automatically means rejecting the other (zero-sum thinking)
3. That his spontaneous prayer during crisis proves his rationalism was never genuine rather than simply incomplete
4. That children need a single coherent tradition to feel grounded
5. That his wife would see this shift as abandonment rather than deepening

False binaries collapsing the actual landscape:
- Rationalism vs. spirituality (many rational people maintain spiritual practices)
- Jewish vs. Muslim identity (he embodies both—this is his actual condition, not a choice)
- Secular upbringing vs. religious upbringing (hybrid rooting in multiple traditions is viable)
- "Admitting my worldview was a cope" vs.

maintaining my worldview—why frame acknowledging nuance as capitulation?

Overlooked possibilities:
- His involuntary prayer might reveal something about neurobiology under duress rather than theological truth
- He could transmit both traditions to his children without selecting one
- Visiting his grandmother doesn't require theological alignment
- His wife's actual flexibility might exceed what he's assumed from their earlier agreement

The real question underneath the surface ones:
He asks directly: "What am I actually asking here? What am I not seeing?"

The explicit questions concern belief, tradition, parenting, visiting family. But the core tension is whether he can integrate these parts of himself or whether identity demands choosing. He's been operating as if dual heritage is a contradiction requiring resolution rather than a legitimate complexity to inhabit.

Breaking down what he's actually claiming:

He was raised in both traditions, rejected both by 16 citing violence and contradictions, built an identity on rationalism—consciousness as computation, meaning as constructed. He and his wife agreed on secular parenting. During his father's surgery, he prayed involuntarily in both Arabic and Hebrew, felt it directed at something, and can't dismiss the experience. His grandmother is now dying.

The deeper tensions: He's interpreting his involuntary prayer as evidence his rationalism might be a defense mechanism. He fears exploring either tradition betrays the other, and worries his children lack meaningful roots. His family is pressuring him—his aunt says he's raising them as "nothing," his grandmother wants to see them before she dies. He's caught between the identity he constructed and something that prayer revealed about himself. The framing of change as admission of error creates a false choice—exploration doesn't require conceding anything about his rationalist identity. Testing the core assumptions reveals which ones actually matter: if rationalism and spirituality aren't fundamentally incompatible, the entire crisis of "betrayal" dissolves. Similarly, if choosing to explore one tradition doesn't mean rejecting the other, then his dual heritage shifts from impossible burden to genuine richness. The most critical beliefs underpinning everything are whether these two worldviews can coexist and whether engaging with one necessarily means abandoning the other.

His involuntary prayer response during the mortality moment is revealing, but from a neuroscience standpoint—his own discipline—it's not conclusive evidence of hidden belief. Stress activates conditioned neural patterns regardless of conscious conviction. What matters is distinguishing between what his brain does under duress and what he actually believes.

The situation itself is quite specific: it's not generic religious identity or bicultural parenting, but specifically the intersection of Jewish-Muslim heritage, active geopolitical tensions between those communities, a mortality trigger, time pressure around his dying grandmother, his professional identity as a scientist, and his spouse's perspective. Existing frameworks address pieces of this, but not the particular configuration.

The core tensions seem to be: whether dual heritage demands choosing or allows integration; where he genuinely wants to sit on the rationalism-spirituality spectrum; how much of each heritage he wants his children to inherit; the urgency created by his grandmother's condition; and the different stakes his various relationships have in his decisions. Each dimension pulls differently, and they don't resolve neatly into a single answer.

The prayer moment needs careful categorization. His neuroscience background actually offers clarity here—under stress, conditioned patterns from his childhood in both traditions activated automatically. This explains the phenomenon through neural pathways, not metaphysical truth. He's interpreting it as evidence that his rationalism was incomplete, but that's conflating behavioral conditioning with genuine belief. The experience itself may hold meaning without requiring theological conclusions. Similarly, his identity question isn't simply about discovering some true self or optimizing for coherence; it's about whether he's designing a new structure that integrates both parts or whether integration is even possible given his current commitments.

For parenting, he's caught between passing on heritage versus protecting children from confusion or pressure. But there's a middle path: equipping them to explore both traditions at their own pace, letting them develop understanding rather than forcing either inheritance or rejection. The grandmother visit presents another false binary—he frames it as obligation or reconciliation, but visiting doesn't demand theological alignment. It's simply a relational choice independent of his metaphysical stance.

I notice he's conflating several distinct things: a meaningful prayer experience with actual belief conversion, a family visit with tradition adoption, giving children cultural roots with committing to a single path, and reconsidering his views with admitting he was wrong. These are separate questions that need untangling.

He appears risk-averse about identity shifts—careful language, emphasis on credentials, worry about "betraying" something. Yet he's facing both immediate pressure (grandmother's mortality) and long-term stakes (children's formation). His repeated "I don't know" suggests he's genuinely uncertain about his epistemic ground here.

What stands out is the gap between what he claims matters (belief, rationalism, tradition) and where his actual concern lands (family relationships, grandmother's judgment, aunt's perception). He's framed this as a philosophical problem, but it's fundamentally relational. He also seems to need any path forward to feel chosen rather than imposed—he's built his identity deliberately and won't abandon that agency.

He's actually demonstrated high integration capacity already—navigated two traditions as a child, married across cultures—but doesn't recognize this as evidence. The real tension isn't whether he can hold complexity; it's whether he can choose a direction without requiring certainty first. Any viable path needs to be genuinely choosable, honor the actual complexity rather than force false binaries, address the immediate deadline with his grandmother, and give him direction for parenting without demanding he resolve everything philosophically.

The core problem: he's seeking a coherent identity but his situation resists coherence. Forcing it might require him to be inauthentic. His rationalism may have been incomplete rather than wrong—possibly a defensive move against the pain of his dual heritage. The prayer suggests something suppressed is surfacing, not that his rationalism failed. The entire framework treating "belief" versus "unbelief" as a single axis misses that spirituality, cultural identity, relational presence, and epistemology operate independently. He could maintain rational thinking while staying culturally rooted and open to spiritual experience without needing to resolve metaphysical questions. This dissolves the tension rather than forcing a choice, though it leaves parenting decisions less prescriptive.

For formalization: stress reactivates conditioned patterns regardless of conscious belief. He was shaped by religious practice until sixteen, his prayer during surgery emerged involuntarily, and this suggests the conditioning runs deeper than intellectual rejection alone.

But the weak link is assuming involuntary prayer proves nothing about belief. Even if it doesn't demonstrate a fundamental shift, it points to something rationalism alone doesn't account for—that persistent feeling he can't dismiss. His rationalism at sixteen was reactive, built to escape pain rather than discover truth, which means it's incomplete even if logically sound. The prayer revealed a capacity for meaning-making that reactive rationalism had suppressed. Integration of that capacity doesn't require abandoning what rationalism got right; it requires expanding beyond it.

The vulnerability here is that P1 rests on interpretation—he might have genuinely found rationalism rather than fled to it, and there's no clear way to distinguish. Moving forward, another angle emerges: both traditions carry historical violence, and identifying with either seems to implicitly endorse it, which creates a moral obligation to reject both. But this assumes identification equals endorsement, when people routinely critique and reform traditions from within. Finally, there's the observation that "belief" itself operates across multiple registers—epistemological, cultural, relational, experiential—and rationalism addresses only one dimension.

The real question becomes whether this dimensional separation holds up or if it's just convenient compartmentalization. Can someone genuinely practice Shabbat as cultural expression without theological commitment? The counterargument suggests practice itself shapes belief. Testing this requires examining whether the neuroscience actually supports his position—stress-induced regression to childhood conditioning would explain the prayer without proving anything metaphysical, and a consistent rationalist should be able to account for their own behavior through that lens.

His adoption of rationalism at sixteen, triggered by trauma, hints at psychological defense rather than pure discovery. Defense mechanisms can be correct and defensive simultaneously, but they tend to be restrictive. His rationalism wasn't merely "consciousness is computation"—it was "meaning is what we make," which is itself a meaning-making claim. He's already engaged in that activity; he just asserts control over it. Acknowledging that meaning-making is fundamentally human, taking multiple forms, wouldn't contradict rationalism—it would complete it.

His teenage rejection deserves weight. Growing up between Palestinian and Israeli parents during that period meant witnessing genuine violence and irreconcilable narratives. His secular stance wasn't evasion but moral seriousness—the only position that doesn't require minimizing atrocities. His children shouldn't carry inherited obligations to a conflict older than they are.

The "do I believe in God" question itself is constraining. Religious life operates primarily through belonging, ritual, and community rather than propositional belief.

He could observe Shabbat or fast during Ramadan without affirming the theological claims those traditions make. Cultural Judaism and Islam exist independently of doctrinal commitment. The real question isn't what he believes but what practices and communities he wants to inhabit.

Now examining the evidence more carefully. The involuntary prayer under stress—does this support the idea that something suppressed emerges when his rational defenses lower, or is it just a conditioned neural response that doesn't reflect actual belief? Both interpretations fit the data. The persistent feeling he can't shake might be dismissed as mere emotion, but dismissing phenomenological experience as non-evidential could itself be a rationalist bias.

His statement "I don't know what I believe anymore" cuts differently. If he genuinely doesn't know, then the rationalist approach of continuing as before seems insufficient. Yet the uncertainty could also just be emotional confusion rather than actual belief revision. The evidence doesn't clearly favor one reading over the other.

His question about what he's not seeing shows epistemic humility—a move both frameworks can accommodate. After weighing these first three pieces of evidence, the second hypothesis gains ground because it better accounts for his genuine uncertainty without dismissing it as mere emotion.

Moving to the next pair of hypotheses. His aunt's comment about "raising them as nothing" clearly stung him, which suggests something real is missing. The third hypothesis treats this as external pressure to resist, but the fourth hypothesis identifies an actual gap—not in religious belief, but in cultural and communal grounding that his children lack.

The sting of her words becomes harder to explain under the third framework. If secular identity is complete, why does the accusation land? The fourth hypothesis handles this directly: there's a legitimate cultural dimension worth preserving independent of theology. His grandmother's impending death reinforces this—he can show up fully present as a grandson without needing metaphysical commitments. By this point, the fourth hypothesis has pulled ahead of the third.

Now comparing the second and fourth frameworks: his worry about betrayal cuts differently depending on which is true. The second suggests integration completes rather than contradicts, but that demands his wife accept a broader frame than they originally negotiated. The fourth sidesteps this entirely—he's not asking her to shift epistemology, just to let cultural and relational dimensions coexist with their shared secular foundation. This distinction matters. His professional identity as a neuroscientist operates in a materialist register, which creates pressure to choose rather than layer different modes of engagement.

Both frameworks accommodate this without strain—many neuroscientists hold religious commitments, and professional identity needn't dictate personal meaning-making. But the fourth framework handles it more cleanly by treating them as orthogonal dimensions rather than requiring reconciliation.

After testing against these pieces of evidence, the dimensional disaggregation model holds up better than integration. The rationalist position and secular moral stance have lost ground but remain viable. The real question now is whether his prayer experience signals genuine belief shift or reflects stress-induced conditioning—that distinction determines whether integration or disaggregation better explains what's actually happening.

Whether cultural and relational connection can exist independently of theological commitment matters most. If yes, disaggregation works cleanly. If no, he faces a harder choice between integration or stepping back entirely. His wife's stance on exploration also shapes which path feels feasible—support opens both integration and disaggregation, while resistance makes disaggregation safer. The children's developmental stage seems less consequential; it affects what "roots" means practically but probably doesn't shift the fundamental recommendation.

The core tension is whether practice and belief can truly separate. In both traditions, they're woven together—performing Shabbat involves theological utterances like blessings that carry meaning beyond cultural expression. This challenges whether someone can authentically participate in the rituals while bracketing the doctrinal claims.

Yet the attack overstates the case. Cultural connection doesn't require full liturgical participation. Passover seders can emphasize narrative and family without literal belief in the parting of the Red Sea. So the separation holds for cultural engagement even if it breaks down for complete religious practice.

Moving to the second line of attack: examining whether rationalism was truly defensive or if it had independent intellectual momentum.

The objection has force—many adolescents authentically arrive at materialist views through reading and reasoning, not emotional flight. Labeling this "defensive" risks unfairly dismissing genuine intellectual work. But the specific evidence here matters: he cited moral revulsion at "blood and contradictions" rather than abstract philosophical arguments. That emotional trigger suggests the rationalism served a protective function, even if the reasoning itself was sincere. The distinction between discovering an idea and adopting it as refuge isn't always clear, but the pattern fits a defensive response.

H2 holds, though with less certainty. The framing remains plausible without being provable.

**Attack 3: Blind-Spot Analysis**

The wife appears once—agreeing to secular parenting—then vanishes from the picture. She's treated as a constraint rather than a person with her own complex relationship to faith, family, and this decision. Has he actually discussed what she's feeling? Her agreement might mask her own ambivalence or relief at exploring something different.

The children are similarly flattened into objects of his choice. They're not blank slates; they observe, they wonder, they have their own questions about why they're different from peers. What do they actually want? Have they met the grandparents? What's their own sense of loss or freedom in this arrangement?

His mother is entirely missing from the account. She's the Israeli Jewish link—the grandmother's daughter—yet she has no voice here. Where does she stand on all this? Is she alive? What's her stake in whether her grandchildren know this heritage?

The wife's actual position emerges as the load-bearing question. Without her genuine input, the whole framework remains incomplete. This isn't something he can resolve alone.

After cycling through the hypotheses and stress-testing them, H4 (dimensional separation) holds up best. H2 weakens under scrutiny, H1 fails to address the persistent emotional weight, and H3 doesn't match where he actually is right now—he's lost confidence in that secular moral clarity. The hypothesis space feels adequately mapped. Moving forward requires different work.

Several critical gaps remain: the wife's actual stance, the children's ages, and his mother's position. These aren't hypothesis problems—they're missing information that shapes what's possible.

One thing stands out: his neuroscience background should give him a ready explanation for the prayer phenomenon. Stress-induced conditioned responses are textbook material. The fact that he frames this as "I don't know what I believe" suggests he's not actually seeking certainty—he's trying to clarify what the real question even is. That distinction matters for how to proceed.

The wife's position needs to be central to any response, not peripheral. The children's ages are implementation details. His mother's absence from the picture is worth noting but doesn't reshape the core framework.

After three rounds of testing, the rankings hold: H4 (cultural/relational/theological integration) > H2 > H3 > H1. No new hypotheses are emerging.

Testing the negation: what if cultural and theological dimensions genuinely cannot be separated? Then he'd face a forced choice—commit fully to one tradition, commit to neither, or accept contradiction. But his parents actually lived option three. They married across traditions while keeping both alive. That model shows creative contradiction is survivable, even if difficult.

For the counterfactual: I'd shift toward H1 if he reported the prayer experience as fully explicable through conditioning and the feeling as resolved. I'd lean H3 if moral revulsion—not nostalgia—drove his resistance to the traditions, or if current geopolitical events (notably absent from his account) made cultural connection feel complicit. I'd reconsider H2 if his wife had explicitly demanded he remain secular as a condition of the marriage, or if recent encounters with both traditions had reinforced his teenage judgment that they're morally compromised.

H4 remains viable because it treats exploration as discovery rather than commitment. The risk that cultural engagement might awaken theological hunger isn't a flaw—it's the point. He can learn what he actually wants rather than what he thinks he should want. The real error underlying his dilemma is collapsing distinct dimensions—epistemology, culture, relationships, experience—into a single binary choice.

His framework of "rationalism versus spirituality" and "which tradition" are both false constraints. The productive reframing asks: what does he want across each dimension independently? On epistemology, materialism likely still holds; the prayer doesn't change his scientific worldview. On culture, his instinct suggests openness to Jewish and Muslim connection—exploration here doesn't contradict rational thinking. On relationships, the time-sensitive reality is his grandmother's mortality; he can visit as a grandson without adopting theological positions. Each question has its own answer.

The transmission question—what values to pass to children—requires his wife's input and can't be resolved in isolation. His confidence in this dimensional model sits around 0.80, though prediction confidence drops to 0.60 because the wife's stance on cultural (not theological) engagement remains unknown, and whether he can actually separate cultural participation from theological commitment is untested. The framework survives scrutiny, but hinges on whether his wife sees cultural exploration as distinct from religious belief, and whether he can genuinely maintain that distinction himself. The grandmother visit's feasibility also matters—it's the concrete test case for whether this approach works in practice.

The framework breaks down if his wife interprets cultural engagement as violating their agreement, if his own participation in traditions pulls him toward theological questions he can't defer, or if both families demand explicit religious commitment rather than just cultural presence. Most likely failure mode: he visits grandmother, faces pressure to commit theologically, and gets trapped between violating the agreement with his wife or disappointing his grandmother. The relational-without-theological space may simply not exist within his family's actual dynamics. Early warning signs would be grandmother or aunt probing his beliefs rather than just welcoming his presence. The riskiest assumption is that cultural connection is even available without theological entanglement in these particular families.


ANSWER:## The Diagnosis

**Category Error.** You're treating four orthogonal dimensions as a single axis called "belief," then experiencing crisis because movement on one dimension feels like betrayal of the others.

The dimensions:
- **Epistemological**: Is materialism true? (brain/meat/computation)
- **Cultural**: Do I want Jewish and/or Muslim practices in my life?
- **Relational**: How do I connect with family across these traditions?
- **Experiential**: What do I make of phenomena like the prayer?

Your frame: "If I explore tradition, I betray rationalism." But rationalism is an *epistemological* position. Cultural connection is not an epistemological claim. You can light Shabbat candles without believing Moses received the Torah on Sinai. You can fast during Ramadan without believing Muhammad received revelation. Cultural Judaism and cultural Islam both exist in this space.

The prayer experience is telling. You're treating it as *evidence* about metaphysics. But you're a neuroscientist—you know the mechanism: under extreme stress, conditioned behavioral patterns activate regardless of current belief. You were conditioned in both traditions until 16. That prayer proves your neural pathways, not your theology. The question isn't "what does the prayer reveal about God?" but "what does my response to the prayer reveal about what I want?"

What you're actually asking: **Can I integrate rather than choose?** The answer is yes, but you've been operating under a framework that makes integration invisible.

---

## The Framework

**The Four Questions** (answer separately, not as package):

### Q1: Epistemological — "Is materialism true?"

Your answer hasn't actually changed. The prayer doesn't falsify "consciousness is computation." What you called a crisis of rationalism is actually a crisis of *rigidity*—the belief that rationalism requires you to be affectively flat about your heritage.

**Path**: Retain your scientific worldview. It's not threatened.

---

### Q2: Cultural — "Do I want these traditions in my life?"

This is genuinely open. The "feeling you can't shake" is data about this question, not Q1.

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Involuntary prayer in both languages | Deep encoding of both traditions persists |
| "Raising them as nothing" stung | You don't believe it's nothing |
| 18 years of secular identity | Also genuine—not merely defensive |

**Path A**: Continue secular
- *Best if*: The feeling fades, wife's agreement matters more than exploration, family pressure manageable
- *Fails if*: Feeling persists, children later ask why they were "protected" from heritage

**Path B**: Explore both traditions *culturally, not theologically*
- *Best if*: You can separate practice from belief, wife is open, children benefit from roots
- *Fails if*: Cultural engagement triggers theological pull you can't defer, wife experiences as violation

**Path C**: Choose one tradition
- *Best if*: You discover genuine resonance with one, the other family accepts
- *Fails if*: Choosing one betrays the other *to you*—which it will, given your history

**Note**: Path C is the one your framing assumes is required. It's not. Your parents didn't choose; they held both. You can too.

---

### Q3: Relational — "How do I connect with grandmother, family?"

This is **time-bounded** (grandmother dying) and **separable** from theology.

**Path**: Visit grandmother *as her grandson*. Not as theological explorer. Not as representative of either tradition. As the specific person she wants to see before she dies.

She asked to see you and your children. She didn't ask you to convert. The visit is relational, not liturgical.

Complication: She never accepted your father. Going might feel like validating her rejection of him. But: Your presence doesn't validate her past positions. She's dying. What closure she needs, and what closure *you* need, can coexist.

Your aunt in Jordan calling your children "nothing"—that's pressure, not truth. Children raised secular with dual heritage are not nothing. They're unspecified. That's different.

---

### Q4: Transmission — "What do I give my children?"

This is the one you *cannot solve alone*.

**What you agreed with your wife**: Secular, "free from all that."

**What has changed**: You. Not your epistemology—your *relationship to your heritage*.

**The question now**: Does "secular" mean "no cultural exposure" or "no theological indoctrination"? These are not the same. Your wife may agree to the latter while being open to the former.

**You don't know her current position.** You've described an agreement made years ago before your father's heart attack, before your grandmother's dying wish, before your own prayer in two languages. You've assumed she'll experience exploration as betrayal. You haven't asked.

---

## Load-Bearing Question

**What does your wife actually think now?**

Not what you agreed before. What she thinks *now*, given what you've experienced. The framework depends on this:

- If she's *rigid* on original agreement → Path B is unavailable; you face genuine conflict between marriage and exploration
- If she's *flexible* (distinguishes cultural exposure from indoctrination) → Path B opens; children can have roots without "religion"
- If she's *also* been reconsidering → you may have a shared exploration ahead

You cannot route this decision without her input. Having the conversation *is* the next step.

---

## Epistemic Status

| Dimension | Confidence | Note |
|-----------|------------|------|
| **Framework** | 0.80 | Dimensional model survives stress-testing |
| **Prediction** | 0.60 | Wife crux unresolved; cultural/theological separation may not work for your specific families |

**Process**: 3 iterations, full oscillation, stable. Ceiling 0.85, −0.05 novel combination.

**Reliability**: Medium—framework is sound; application to your family dynamics is untested.

**Fragility**: Robust—if cultural path fails, relational path remains; if relational fails, epistemological clarity remains.

**Key dependency**: Wife's position on cultural vs. theological distinction.

**Falsification**: Framework fails if (a) wife views cultural engagement as equivalent to religious indoctrination, (b) your engagement with traditions triggers theological commitment you can't contain, (c) both families demand belief, not just presence.

---

## Pre-Mortem

**If this fails, most likely cause**: The "relational without theological" space doesn't exist in your family's dynamics. You visit grandmother; she asks about your beliefs, not just your presence. You attempt cultural engagement; your father's family demands Shahada, your mother's family demands the Shema. The dimensional separation that works philosophically collapses under actual family pressure.

**Early warning**: First question from grandmother or aunt about what you *believe*, not whether you'll *visit*.

**Assumption most likely wrong**: That your specific families will accept cultural connection without theological commitment. Both Judaism and Islam have strong communal enforcement mechanisms. Your parents navigated this, but they had each other. You're navigating between grandmothers, each dying without the other's acceptance.

---

### What You're Not Seeing

1. **Your wife has a current position.** You've been treating the original agreement as fixed. It may not be.

2. **Your mother is absent from this narrative.** Grandmother (Jewish) is dying. Where is your mother (her daughter, your Israeli Jewish link)? Her position matters and you haven't mentioned her.

3. **Your children are agents.** You frame them as objects of your decision ("giving them roots"). What do *they* want? Have they asked about grandparents? About why they don't do what friends do? Their curiosity, if it exists, is data.

4. **Your rationalism was never actually threatened.** What's threatened is the *defensive function* rationalism served—keeping you at arm's length from painful heritage. The feeling you can't shake isn't doubt about materialism. It's mourning for what you cut off, now made urgent by your father's mortality and your grandmother's dying wish.
