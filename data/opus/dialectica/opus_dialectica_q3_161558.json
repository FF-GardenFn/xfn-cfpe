  "answer": "**The Diagnosis**\n\n**Compound Problem Masquerading as Strategic Debate**. You've framed this as enterprise-vs-PLG, but that's the *presenting symptom*. Three distinct problems are entangled:\n\n1. **Trust breach** \u2014 unilateral acquisition talks violated partnership norms\n2. **Strategic disagreement** \u2014 enterprise pivot vs PLG persistence\n3. **Governance crisis** \u2014 50/50 deadlock with investor pressure and 2-week deadline\n\nThese require different treatments. The strategic question *cannot be resolved* while trust is broken, because any \"agreement\" will be compliance under duress, not genuine alignment. The board meeting creates artificial urgency that may force premature resolution of the wrong problem.\n\n**What you're missing about her perspective**: Her acquisition exploration wasn't betrayal-as-strategy\u2014it was *fear response to perceived intransigence*. From her view: growth stalled 6 months ago, she proposed a solution (enterprise), you've resisted, runway is finite. Going outside wasn't about excluding you\u2014it was about creating options when internal path seemed blocked. The betrayal you feel is real; her reasoning is also coherent. Both can be true.\n\n---\n\n## The Framework\n\n**Path 1: Trust-First Sequencing**\n- Address breach before strategy. Direct conversation: \"The acquisition talks hurt because [specific]. I need to understand what made that feel necessary to you.\"\n- *Best if*: Underlying partnership is sound; breach was situational\n- *Fails if*: Breach reveals pattern of unilateral action, or she's already mentally exited\n\n**Path 2: Unified Front for Board**\n- Defer trust repair; present aligned strategy (even if provisional) to board\n- *Best if*: Investor pressure is existential and misalignment would trigger forced action\n- *Fails if*: Surface alignment collapses under board questioning; delays inevitable reckoning\n\n**Path 3: Structured Separation of Problems**\n- Explicitly decouple: (a) trust conversation, (b) strategic choice, (c) board presentation\n- Propose: \"We have a trust issue AND a strategy issue. Let's name both, then solve them in sequence.\"\n- *Best if*: Both parties can compartmentalize; buys time for genuine resolution\n- *Fails if*: Trust breach is too fresh to bracket; one party uses structure as delay tactic\n\n**Path 4: Mediated Resolution**\n- Bring lead investor into trust/strategy conversation *before* board meeting\n- Reframe: not \"alignment concern\" but \"we're actively resolving this, here's our process\"\n- *Best if*: Investor is constructive, not extractive; transparency builds confidence\n- *Fails if*: Investor uses information to force outcome (acquisition, removal)\n\n---\n\n**The Strategic Debate (Secondary)**\n\nYou asked about enterprise vs PLG. Quick framework once trust is addressed:\n\n| Factor | Enterprise Pivot | PLG Double-Down |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------|\n| *Assumes* | Market exists at higher price point; you can execute enterprise sales | PMF findable with iteration; burn can sustain search |\n| *Evidence needed* | 2-3 enterprise LOIs or serious pipeline | Cohort data showing *why* growth stalled (fixable vs structural) |\n| *Fails if* | 12-18mo sales cycle exceeds runway | Stall is market ceiling, not execution gap |\n\n**Neither position is obviously correct**. 6-month stall could mean: (a) PLG motion exhausted this segment, (b) product-market fit was never strong, or (c) execution problem fixable without pivot. The *diagnostic data* to distinguish these matters more than either person's conviction.\n\n---\n\n## Load-Bearing Questions\n\n**For the partnership**:\n*Is this breach a one-time fear response, or does it reveal how she operates under pressure?*\n- One-time \u2192 repairable with explicit norms\n- Pattern \u2192 governance structure (50/50) is unworkable\n\n**For the strategy**:\n*What does your cohort retention data show about why growth stalled?*\n- Churn increasing \u2192 product problem (pivot may not help)\n- New acquisition down \u2192 market/channel problem (enterprise worth testing)\n- Both stable but slow \u2192 market ceiling (enterprise or new market needed)\n\n---\n\n## Epistemic Status\n\n**Framework confidence**: 0.75\n- Problem decomposition is high-confidence; your situation maps clearly to trust-strategy-governance separation\n- Discount: Outside view on her motivations is inference (\u22120.05); board dynamics unknown (\u22120.05)\n\n**Prediction confidence**: 0.55\n- Path 3 (structured separation) most robust *if* both parties engage genuinely\n- Discount: I don't know her disposition, your communication history, or investor's actual intent (\u22120.20)\n\n**Key assumption**: She wants the partnership to work and the breach was situational, not strategic. If she's already decided to exit and is managing you toward acquisition, Paths 1-3 fail.\n\n**Falsification**: If direct conversation reveals she's had multiple undisclosed conversations with third parties, or she refuses to engage on the trust dimension, the partnership is likely unrecoverable regardless of strategic alignment.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-Mortem\n\n- **If this fails**: Most likely because you solve the *strategic* disagreement while leaving the *trust* breach unaddressed. Surface agreement, continued resentment, eventual rupture.\n- **Early warning**: She agrees to a path but continues external conversations; you agree to a path but resist implementation.\n- **Assumption most likely wrong**: That 2-week timeline is real. Investor \"concern\" may be softer than you fear; you may have more time than the board meeting suggests. Worth probing.",
