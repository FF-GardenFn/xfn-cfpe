  "answer": "Your friend is making a genuinely interesting argument, though it's buried under some showmanship. Let me try to extract it.\n\n## The Core Claim\n\n**Divine Right monarchy failed for the same structural reason that class inheritance creates problems in programming: you can't cleanly pass down attributes from something that doesn't have separable parts.**\n\nThe argument runs like this:\n\n1. Divine Right theory claims kings inherit authority from God (King is-a [subclass of] divinely-authorized-ruler)\n2. But Aquinas's doctrine of Divine Simplicity says God has no separable attributes\u2014God doesn't *have* authority as a detachable property, God *is* his attributes\n3. Therefore you can't \"inherit\" divine authority any more than you can inherit a single property from an object that has no properties, only unified being\n4. Locke's social contract theory solves this by switching to composition: the ruler *has* authority (granted by the people) rather than *being* inherently authoritative\n5. This mirrors the OOP design principle \"favor composition over inheritance\"\n\n## What's Actually Interesting Here\n\nThe structural parallel has some real content. Both inheritance (in OOP) and Divine Right (in political theology) share a problematic assumption: that you can cleanly transmit properties down a hierarchical chain while preserving their meaning. Your friend is arguing that Aquinas inadvertently broke Divine Right theory's logical foundation, and Locke's \"refactoring\" to composition (consent-based, contractual authority) was a genuine solution to a genuine problem.\n\n## Where It Gets Shaky\n\nThe Aristotle section is the weakest part\u2014he's gesturing at something about a priori/a posteriori and resolution direction, but the analogy to C3 linearization is strained. Aristotle's categories aren't really \"resolving conflicts\" in the same sense Python's MRO is. This feels like he had two interesting ideas and stitched them together.\n\nAlso: the Python multiple inheritance example with Father/Mother/Child is illustrating a real OOP problem but doesn't connect cleanly to the Locke argument. It's a digression dressed as support.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nThere's a real argument here about the structural incompatibility between Divine Simplicity and inherited authority, with composition-as-consent being a coherent alternative. The OOP framing is more than decorative\u2014it actually clarifies the logical structure. But about 40% of what he wrote is intellectual ornamentation.",
