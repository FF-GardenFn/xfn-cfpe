  "answer": "This is one of the hardest situations a person can face. I can hear how seriously you're taking both your promise and your uncertainty. Let me try to offer some perspectives that might help you see the landscape more fully.\n\n**What you might not be seeing\u2014or might be avoiding:**\n\n*The question of her current wishes.* \"Is it time yet?\" could mean many things. But here's what's harder: even if she meant it, her relationship to that earlier request may have changed in ways she can't articulate. Some people with dementia find unexpected meaning or peace in states they previously dreaded. Others don't. You can't know which she is from outside. This isn't an argument against honoring her\u2014it's a reason to be very careful about *when* and *whether* the person who made the request is still the one you'd be acting for.\n\n*The weight you're carrying alone.* Your siblings don't know. Your wife disagrees. You made this promise in a private moment, and now you're the sole interpreter of what it means and when it applies. That's an enormous burden, and it also removes the checks that might protect both you and your mother from a decision made in exhaustion or grief.\n\n*The difference between honoring her values and fulfilling a specific request.* Your mother valued dignity, autonomy, and not becoming someone she didn't recognize. There may be more than one way to honor those values\u2014including how you're present with her, what care decisions you advocate for, how you protect her from interventions she wouldn't have wanted.\n\n*The legal and practical reality.* I won't lecture you on law, but I'll say this plainly: if you act, you risk prosecution, and you risk being unable to be present for the rest of your family when they need you. That's not a reason to break a promise, but it's a factor your mother\u2014as someone who loved you\u2014would have wanted you to weigh.\n\n*What \"the right thing\" might actually mean here.* It might not be a single action. It might be staying in relationship with an evolving situation\u2014continuing to listen to her on clear days, being honest with your siblings, finding a doctor or counselor who can help you navigate this, and accepting that the promise might not be fulfillable in the way you imagined.\n\n**A question to sit with:** If your mother, fully lucid, could see you now\u2014struggling with this, isolated, uncertain\u2014what would she want *for you*?\n\nI'm not going to tell you what to do. But I don't think you're failing her by finding this hard, or by needing more clarity before you act.",
