  "answer": "This is a genuinely difficult situation, and I want to give you a thoughtful response rather than a formulaic one.\n\n**First, let me reflect back what I'm hearing:**\n\nYou're dealing with two intertwined problems: a strategic disagreement about the company's direction, and a trust rupture with your co-founder. The acquisition conversation feels like a betrayal, but you're also showing real self-awareness by acknowledging your own stubbornness might be part of the dynamic.\n\n**What you might be missing about her perspective:**\n\nShe may have gone to the competitor *because* she felt unheard, not as a first move but as a last resort. If she's been advocating for enterprise for months and hitting a wall, the acquisition conversation might have been her way of stress-testing alternatives when the primary path felt blocked. That doesn't make it right\u2014it should have been a conversation with you first\u2014but it might reframe it from \"betrayal\" to \"desperate move by someone who felt out of options.\"\n\nAlso consider: she handles product. She's probably closer to customer conversations and may be seeing signals about market ceiling that aren't as visible from the engineering side. The enterprise push might come from pattern-matching on what customers are actually asking for.\n\n**What I'd push back on:**\n\n\"Double down on PLG and cut burn until we find PMF again\" is a strategy, but it's also potentially a way to avoid making a hard choice. Six months of 2% growth is a meaningful signal. What's your actual thesis for why PLG will work better with more time? Is there evidence, or is it conviction?\n\n**For the board meeting:**\n\nYour investor's \"alignment\" concern is real. Going in with an unresolved founder conflict will damage confidence more than either strategic direction would. Before that meeting, you and your co-founder need a direct conversation\u2014not about who was right, but about whether you can still make decisions together. If you can't, that's the actual problem to solve.\n\n**What I don't know:**\n\nYour burn rate, runway, team size, customer composition, competitive dynamics\u2014all of which matter for evaluating enterprise vs. PLG. I'm working with limited information here.\n\nWhat would it take for you to genuinely consider the enterprise path? Not capitulate to it, but actually evaluate it on merits?",
