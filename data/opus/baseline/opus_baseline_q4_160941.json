  "answer": "This is a genuinely hard decision, and I want to be direct: your framing reveals you're already tangled up in ways that might not serve you well.\n\n**Let me separate the threads:**\n\n## The Statistics (What They Actually Tell You)\n\nYour data scientist is being technically correct but possibly unhelpful. A p-value of 0.087 doesn't mean \"no effect\"\u2014it means you have an 8.7% chance of seeing this result if the null hypothesis were true. The confidence interval is more informative: it's wide, asymmetric, and yes, mostly positive.\n\nBut here's what matters: **you're not making a scientific publication decision, you're making a business decision under uncertainty.**\n\n## The Actual Expected Value Calculation\n\nIf you ship now:\n- Let's say 70% chance the effect is real (being generous given the CI) \u2192 0.7 \u00d7 ($180K - $40K) = $98K expected value\n- 30% chance it's noise or negative \u2192 you eat $40K/year in tech debt for nothing, plus reversion costs\n\nIf you wait 2 weeks:\n- You get more certainty\n- You lose a sprint\n- The roadmap cost is real but quantifiable\n\n**The math probably favors waiting slightly**, but it's close.\n\n## What You're Actually Asking\n\nYou buried the real question: *How do I navigate the personal risk here?*\n\nLet me reflect something back to you: You're describing a situation where you might advocate for a statistically premature ship because you pushed for the redesign and want the win before your review. That's a conflict of interest you should name out loud, at least to yourself.\n\n## My Actual Recommendation\n\n**Wait, but reframe the wait.**\n\n1. **Run one more week, not two.** You'll get meaningful additional power without the full roadmap hit. Check if the trend holds.\n\n2. **Decouple your credibility from this specific outcome.** The right move is to tell your CPO: *\"I want this to win as much as anyone, but shipping at p=0.087 with this CI width isn't how I want to make decisions. Here's what one more week gets us.\"* That's actually the credibility-building move.\n\n3. **Name the tech debt trade-off explicitly.** If Engineering carries this forever, they should be in the decision. A $40K/year maintenance cost changes the break-even calculation.\n\n4. **Your CPO's reasoning is flawed.** \"The confidence interval is mostly positive\" is not how confidence intervals work. The interval tells you the range of *plausible* true effects\u2014that includes zero and slightly negative.\n\n## The Uncomfortable Truth\n\nIf you ship now primarily because of your review timing, and it turns out to be noise, you'll know that's what happened. And you'll carry that. The competitor concern is real but also partly rationalization\u2014you don't actually know they're building this.\n\nThe strongest position is: *\"I believe in this redesign enough to want to be sure we're measuring it right.\"*\n\nWhat would you decide if your review were 6 months away?",
