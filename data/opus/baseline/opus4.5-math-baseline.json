      "thinking": "Let me compute the reduced 12th dimensional Spin bordism of BG₂, denoted $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$.\n\nBy definition, the reduced bordism is the kernel of the map induced by the collapse map $BG_2 \\to pt$, or equivalently, it's $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)/\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The reduced bordism $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_n^{Spin}(X)$ fits into the split exact sequence:\n$$0 \\to \\widetilde{\\Omega}_n^{Spin}(X) \\to \\Omega_n^{Spin}(X) \\to \\Omega_n^{Spin}(pt) \\to 0$$\n\nThe splitting comes from choosing a basepoint in $X$.\n\nSo $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) = \\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)/\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$.\n\nTo compute $\\Omega_*^{Spin}(BG_2)$, I'll use the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS):\n$$E_2^{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; \\Omega_q^{Spin}) \\Rightarrow \\Omega_{p+q}^{Spin}(BG_2)$$\n\nFirst, let me recall some facts:\n\n1. The Spin bordism groups $\\Omega_n^{Spin}$ in low dimensions:\n- $\\Omega_0^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$\n- $\\Omega_1^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n\n\n- $\\Omega_2^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n- $\\Omega_3^{Spin} = 0$\n- $\\Omega_4^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$\n- $\\Omega_5^{Spin} = 0$\n- $\\Omega_6^{Spin} = 0$\n- $\\Omega_7^{Spin} = 0$\n- $\\Omega_8^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$\n- $\\Omega_9^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n- $\\Omega_{10}^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n- $\\Omega_{11}^{Spin} = 0$\n- $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^3$\n\nFor the cohomology ring of $BG_2$, the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ is simply connected with trivial fundamental group, and its classifying space admits an integral cohomology structure generated by Pontryagin classes, though I need to determine the precise relations.\n\nOver the rationals, $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[y_4, y_{12}]$ with generators in degrees 4 and 12. The integral picture involves torsion that requires careful analysis of the embedding $G_2 \\subset SO(7)$ and how the characteristic classes behave.\n\nLooking at $G_2$ directly, its cohomology is an exterior algebra $\\Lambda_{\\mathbb{Z}}(x_3, x_{11})$ generated by classes in degrees 3 and 11. The Serre spectral sequence relating $G_2 \\to EG_2 \\to BG_2$ determines how these generators transgress to produce the cohomology of the classifying space.\n\nThe transgression sends $x_3$ to a degree 4 class $y_4$ and $x_{11}$ to a degree 12 class $y_{12}$ in $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$. The integral cohomology ring is generated by these classes subject to some relations, though torsion elements complicate the structure. In particular, $H^4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, but the mod 2 reduction reveals additional complexity that needs careful analysis.\n\nLooking at the mod 2 cohomology, $G_2$ embeds in $SO(7)$ via its standard 7-dimensional representation, which induces a map $BG_2 \\to BSO(7)$. The Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_4, w_6, w_7$ pull back to give generators of $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$. Since $G_2$ is connected and lies in $SO(7)$, the first two Stiefel-Whitney classes vanish, and the structure is determined by the higher classes.\n\nFor computing the AHSS, I need the integral homology rather than cohomology. The rational homology of $BG_2$ is generated by classes in degrees 4 and 12, dual to the polynomial generators of the rational cohomology ring. This means the homology has a specific pattern based on these fundamental degrees. For integral homology, I need to use the relationship $\\pi_k(BG) = \\pi_{k-1}(G)$. Since $G_2$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(BG_2) = 0$, which means $H_1(BG_2) = 0$. The homology groups in low degrees follow from the homotopy groups of $G_2$: $H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_2(BG_2) = 0$, $H_3(BG_2) = 0$, and $H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ corresponding to the generator in degree 4.\n\nLooking at the homotopy groups of $BG_2$, I can read off the known homotopy groups of $G_2$ shifted by one degree. The key non-trivial groups are $\\pi_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_7(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/3$, $\\pi_9(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $\\pi_{10}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/6$, and $\\pi_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, with most other low-degree homotopy groups vanishing.\n\nBy the Hurewicz theorem, since $BG_2$ is simply connected with trivial $\\pi_2$ and $\\pi_3$, the first nontrivial homology group appears in degree 4 where $H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$. For the higher homology groups, I need to use the Serre spectral sequence or known results about the cohomology ring structure of $BG_2$. Since $G_2$ is 2-connected, $BG_2$ is 3-connected, which constrains the low-degree homology. The cohomology ring $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ has a specific structure determined by the characteristic classes of $G_2$.\n\nLooking at the cohomology of $G_2$ itself, the integral cohomology has generators in degrees 3 and 11, with 2-torsion appearing in degree 6. The cohomology of the classifying space relates to this through transgression, giving nontrivial classes in degrees 4, 7, 12, 14, and 15 in $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFor the mod 2 cohomology of $BG_2$, I should work with the Stiefel-Whitney classes. The mod 2 cohomology ring is generated by $w_4, w_6, w_7$ with a relation between them.\n\nLet me reconsider: $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ should be a polynomial algebra on generators in degrees 4, 6, and 7. This structure comes from understanding $G_2$ through its fibrations and characteristic classes. I need to verify this more systematically using spectral sequence methods or the known structure of the classifying space.\n\nLooking at what's established: the integral cohomology has a generator in degree 4, vanishes in degrees 6 and 7, then reappears in degree 8 with $c^2$, and has another generator in degree 12. The mod 2 reduction captures different information about the torsion structure. }/2[y_4, y_6, y_7]$ where the Bockstein operator $\\beta = Sq^1$ acts on these generators to determine the 2-torsion structure in integral cohomology. The map $\\beta(y_6) = y_7$ suggests a 2-torsion element in $H^7$ that reduces to $y_7$ mod 2.\n\nTo compute $\\Omega_*^{Spin}(BG_2)$, I need the integral homology of $BG_2$ and the differentials in the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. For dimension 12 specifically, I'm looking at contributions from various $E_2^{p,q}$ terms where $p + q = 12$.\n\nThe key is understanding which Spin bordism groups contribute: $\\Omega_0^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\Omega_1^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $\\Omega_2^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $\\Omega_3^{Spin} = 0$, $\\Omega_4^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$, and the groups vanish for $q = 5, 6, 7$ before $\\Omega_8^{Spin}$ appears.\n\nFor dimension 12, I need $\\Omega_8^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\\Omega_9^{Spin} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$, $\\Omega_{10}^{Spin} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$, $\\Omega_{11}^{Spin} = 0$, and $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^3$. The $E_2$ page has $E_2^{0,12} = H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{12}^{Spin}) = \\mathbb{Z}^3$ contributing to the non-reduced part, while $E_2^{1,11} = H_1(BG_2; \\Omega_{11}^{Spin})$ vanishes since $\\Omega_{11}^{Spin} = 0$.\n\nThe remaining terms involve computing cohomology with coefficients in the spin bordism groups: $E_2^{2,10}$ uses $(\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$, $E_2^{3,9}$ also uses $(\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$, and $E_2^{4,8}$ uses $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ as coefficients. $_9(BG_2; \\Omega_3^{Spin}) = H_9(BG_2; 0) = 0$\n- $E_2^{10, 2} = H_{10}(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin}) = H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$\n- $E_2^{11, 1} = H_{11}(BG_2; \\Omega_1^{Spin}) = H_{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$\n- $E_2^{12, 0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega_0^{Spin}) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThe remaining entries continue the pattern where most vanish due to trivial spin cobordism groups, with nontrivial contributions appearing only at specific bidegrees corresponding to nonzero spin cobordism coefficients.\n\nI need to determine the homology of $BG_2$. Since $G_2$ is 2-connected, $BG_2$ is 3-connected, which means the first few homology groups vanish: $H_0(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(BG_2) = H_2(BG_2) = H_3(BG_2) = 0$. By Hurewicz, $H_4(BG_2) = \\pi_3(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Beyond degree 4, the structure becomes intricate, though rationally the homology is concentrated in even degrees.\n\nSpecifically, the rational homology has $H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^2$, with vanishing in the intermediate odd degrees and at $H_5, H_6, H_7, H_9, H_{10}, H_{11}$. For integral homology, I need to account for potential torsion arising from the homotopy groups of $G_2$.\n\nLooking at the homotopy groups: $\\pi_3(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_6(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/3$, $\\pi_8(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, and $\\pi_9(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/6$. These will shift up by one degree in the classifying space, so $\\pi_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_7(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/3$, $\\pi_9(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, and $\\pi_{10}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/6$.\n\nTo find the homology of $BG_2$, I can use the Postnikov tower since $BG_2$ is 3-connected with $\\pi_4 = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis gives $H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_5(BG_2) = 0$. For higher degrees, the homotopy groups $\\pi_7 = \\mathbb{Z}/3$ and others will affect the homology through cell attachments. Rather than computing this directly from the Postnikov tower, which becomes intricate, I should look for established results on the cohomology ring $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe mod 2 and mod 3 cohomology rings are known: $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2[w_4, w_6, w_7]$ and $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3[y_4, y_{12}]$, where these classes relate to characteristic classes from the embedding $G_2 \\subset SO(7)$. Using the universal coefficient theorem with these cohomology computations, I can determine the integral homology groups and their torsion structure.\n\nIn degrees 6 and 7, the mod 2 cohomology has generators $w_6$ and $w_7$, but rationally there are no cohomology classes in these degrees. This means these classes can't lift to integral cohomology with free parts—they must represent pure 2-torsion.\n\nUsing the Universal Coefficient Theorem, if $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, then the mod 2 reduction gives exactly $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$, which matches what we see.\n\nHowever, $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ appears in the computation. Since any free part of $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ would survive to rational cohomology, this degree must be entirely torsion. Applying UCT again: $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ comes from torsion in $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ and possibly from $\\text{Tor}(H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}/2)$.\n\nIf $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (generated by $c^2$), then the Tor term vanishes, forcing $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ to contain a $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ summand. This gives me $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ torsion in both degree 6 and degree 7.\n\nUsing the Universal Coefficient Theorem for homology, I can compute:\n$H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(H^6, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H^7, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n\n$H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(H^7, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}(H^8, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0 \\oplus 0 = 0$ (assuming $H^8 = \\mathbb{Z}$)\n\nBut I need to reconsider this more carefully.\n\nThe correct UCT for homology states: $0 \\to H_n(X) \\otimes G \\to H_n(X; G) \\to \\text{Tor}(H_{n-1}(X), G) \\to 0$\n\nAnd for cohomology: $0 \\to \\text{Ext}(H_{n-1}(X), G) \\to H^n(X; G) \\to \\text{Hom}(H_n(X), G) \\to 0$\n\nIf I can determine $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, these might constrain $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, but this approach is becoming unwieldy. I should focus on what directly applies to the AHSS calculation.\n\nFor the relevant spectral sequence terms, the main contributions to $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$ come from $E_2^{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}^2) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $E_2^{8,4} = H_8$... I need to check the torsion contributions from $H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $H_{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$. Rather than continuing with the spectral sequence approach, I should use the known relationship between Spin bordism and connective K-theory. The map $MSpin \\to ko$ gives an isomorphism on homotopy groups through degree 7, and there's an Anderson-Brown-Peterson decomposition showing how these spectra relate.\n\nFor low-dimensional cases, Spin bordism of a space becomes isomorphic to connective K-theory after inverting 2. The key insight is that a 12-dimensional Spin manifold with a $G_2$ structure is classified by its map to $BG_2$, which determines the principal $G_2$ bundle structure on that manifold.\n\nSince $BG_2$ is 3-connected, maps from a 12-manifold factor through finitely many skeleta, making the classification tractable through characteristic classes. The $G_2$ bundle carries a first Pontryagin class in degree 4 and potentially other invariants in higher degrees, though the full cohomology structure of $BG_2$ becomes intricate to work with directly.\n\nRather than pursuing bundle-theoretic obstructions, I should leverage bordism theory instead. The homology of $BG_2$ has generators in degrees 4, 8, and 12, which suggests these are the relevant dimensions for detecting invariants of 12-dimensional manifolds.\n\nThe free part of the reduced bordism comes from several sources: pairing the degree 4 homology class with 8-dimensional Spin bordism gives $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, the degree 8 class with 4-dimensional Spin bordism contributes another $\\mathbb{Z}$, and the degree 12 class paired with the trivial bordism yields $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. However, differentials in the spectral sequence will eliminate some of these potential generators. The $d_2$ differential is particularly important here since it relates to the structure of the AHSS for Spin bordism. For a general differential $d_r: E_r^{p,q} \\to E_r^{p-r, q+r-1}$, the $d_2$ map sends $E_2^{p,q}$ to $E_2^{p-2, q+1}$. Applying this to the $E_2^{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ term means checking whether $d_2: E_2^{4,8} \\to E_2^{2,9}$ is nontrivial, which requires understanding what $E_2^{2,9} = H_2(BG_2; \\Omega_9^{Spin})$ actually is.\n\nSince $\\Omega_9^{Spin} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ and $H_2(BG_2) = 0$, the target vanishes, so this differential is zero. Similarly, for $E_2^{8,4} = \\mathbb{Z}$, the map $d_2: E_2^{8,4} \\to E_2^{6,5}$ lands in $H_6(BG_2; \\Omega_5^{Spin}) = H_6(BG_2; 0) = 0$, which is also trivial. The $E_2^{12,0}$ term needs checking as well.\n\nFor $E_2^{12,0} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$, the differential $d_2$ maps to $E_2^{10,1} = H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, which could be non-zero. In the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for Spin bordism, the $d_2$ differential is determined by the Pontryagin square operation rather than ordinary Steenrod squares.\n\nLet me reconsider using a more direct approach. There's a useful relationship between $MSpin$ and connective K-theory in low degrees, and I should look at established formulas for Spin bordism of classifying spaces. For simply-connected compact Lie groups, there's a rational formula involving a direct sum indexed by combinations of cohomological degrees and multiples of 4.\n\nSince rational Spin bordism is generated by the signature in degree 4, the Spin bordism of $BG_2$ in degree 12 decomposes as a sum of homology groups in complementary degrees. For degree 12 specifically, this gives contributions from $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q})$ and $H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q})$ among others.\n\nUsing the known homology of $BG_2$—which has $\\mathbb{Q}$ in degrees 0, 4, 8, and 12—I can compute that the total dimension is 5. The reduced bordism group, obtained by quotienting out the contribution from the point, has dimension 4.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful here. The rational Spin bordism ring at a point is generated in specific degrees, and I should verify which dimensions actually contribute to degree 12. Let me reconsider the structure of $\\Omega_*^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ more carefully.\n\nIn dimension 12, the generator would be $x_4^3$ if the ring is polynomial on a single generator in degree 4. This means $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}$, not $\\mathbb{Q}^3$ as I initially thought.\n\nI should verify the actual Spin bordism groups in low dimensions: degree 0 gives $\\mathbb{Z}$, degree 4 has rank 1, and degree 8 has rank 2. This structure will determine what appears in degree 12.\n\nThe signature map provides a homomorphism from Spin bordism to $\\mathbb{Z}$ that's surjective in multiples of 4, but the kernel contains additional torsion-free elements. For Spin manifolds specifically, the $\\hat{A}$-genus is an integer-valued invariant, which suggests there are multiple independent bordism classes beyond just the signature.\n\nIn dimension 4k, the $\\hat{A}$-genus and signature generate distinct bordism invariants. The rational Spin bordism ring appears to be generated by $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ and an 8-dimensional Bott manifold with $\\hat{A}$-genus equal to 1, giving rank 3 in dimension 12 from products like $(\\mathbb{CP}^2)^3$, $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ times the Bott manifold, and related combinations.\n\nBut I need to reconsider—$\\mathbb{CP}^2$ actually fails the Spin condition since $w_2 \\neq 0$. For a manifold to be Spin, both $w_1$ and $w_2$ must vanish. The generators of $\\Omega_*^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ come from different sources like $K3$ surfaces and quaternionic projective spaces. The ring itself is polynomial on generators appearing in dimensions 4, 8, 12, 16, and so on, not concentrated in a single dimension.\n\nIn dimension 12 specifically, I can form elements by taking products and powers of the lower-dimensional generators—like $x_4 \\cdot x_8$ or $x_4^3$—in addition to any generator $x_{12}$ that appears directly in that dimension.\n\nThis gives three independent monomials of total degree 12, so $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is three-dimensional. The torsion-free part of $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(pt)$ should therefore be $\\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\nFor the equivariant case with $BG_2$, I need to apply the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which collapses rationally and lets me compute $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ by understanding how the Spin cobordism ring acts on the cohomology of the classifying space. ^{Spin}) \\Rightarrow \\Omega_{p+q}^{Spin}(X)$\n\nThe key observation is that rationally, $\\Omega_*^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ vanishes except in degrees divisible by 4, where it's generated by $x_4, x_8, x_{12}, \\ldots$. This means the spectral sequence has very sparse terms. I need to recall the precise structure of the Spin bordism ring to proceed correctly.\n\nThe Spin bordism groups have a specific pattern: $\\Omega_0^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\Omega_1^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $\\Omega_2^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, and $\\Omega_3^{Spin} = 0$. Then $\\Omega_4^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$ appears again, followed by zeros until $\\Omega_8^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The pattern continues with torsion appearing in odd degrees like $\\Omega_9^{Spin} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$.\n\nLooking at $\\Omega_{10}^{Spin}$, I need to verify whether it's $(\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ or $(\\mathbb{Z}/2)^3$—I believe it's actually $(\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$. The key observation is that torsion dominates in degrees not divisible by 4, while $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^3$ shows the pattern repeating. When tensoring with $\\mathbb{Q}$, only the free parts survive: $\\Omega_0^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\Omega_4^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nContinuing this pattern, $\\Omega_8^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}^2$ and $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}^3$. For the rational Spin bordism in dimension 12 of $BG_2$, I compute $E_2^{0,12} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = H_0(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes (\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^3$, and I need to examine the contribution from $E_2^{4,8}$ as well.\n\nThe $E_2^{4,8}$ term gives $H_4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes (\\Omega_8^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^2$. Moving to higher filtration degrees, $E_2^{8,4} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) \\otimes (\\Omega_4^{Spin} \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$, and the top filtration $E_2^{12,0}$ involves $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q})$ tensored with the rational Spin bordism in dimension 0.\n\nSumming across all bidegrees where $p + q = 12$ gives a total dimension of $\\mathbb{Q}^8$, though I need to be careful about how these multiplicities arise from different $(p,q)$ pairs. Actually, I'm making this too complicated—the AHSS structure is clearer if I focus on the individual terms. For total degree 12, the relevant pages have $E_2^{0,12}$, $E_2^{4,8}$, and higher filtration terms, each contributing based on the cohomology of $BG_2$ and the Spin bordism ring. otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}^2$\n\nThe total rank across all terms is $3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8$. Since the reduced bordism excludes the contribution from $E_2^{0,12}$, which gives $\\mathbb{Q}^3$ from the trivial bundle case, the reduced group $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ should have rank $5$. But this contradicts my earlier calculation, so I need to reconsider what reduced bordism actually means. The definition of $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_*^{Spin}(X)$ should clarify whether it's genuinely excluding the point contribution or if I'm misunderstanding the construction.\n\nThe $E_2^{0,q}$ terms correspond to $H_0(X) \\otimes \\Omega_q^{Spin} = \\Omega_q^{Spin}$, which maps to $\\Omega_q^{Spin}(pt)$ under the collapse map. This means the reduced bordism only receives contributions from $E_2^{p,q}$ with $p > 0$, so I should focus on those terms: $E_2^{4,8}$, $E_2^{8,4}$, and $E_2^{12,0}$ contribute to the reduced group.\n\nAfter tensoring with $\\mathbb{Q}$, each of these terms gives $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}^2$, yielding a total rank of 5 for $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. To understand the full structure including torsion, I need to examine the integral AHSS more carefully. The potentially non-zero $E_2^{p, 12-p}$ terms with $p > 0$ are limited: $E_2^{1,11}$ vanishes since $\\Omega_{11}^{Spin} = 0$, and $E_2^{2,10}$ also vanishes because $H_2(BG_2)$ has no torsion in the relevant degree. ; 0) = 0$\n- $E_2^{7, 5} = H_7(BG_2; \\Omega_5^{Spin}) = H_7(BG_2; 0) = 0$\n- $E_2^{8, 4} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{Spin}) = H_8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n- $E_2^{9, 3} = H_9(BG_2; \\Omega_3^{Spin}) = H_9(BG_2; 0) = 0$\n- $E_2^{10, 2} = H_{10}(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin}) = H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe remaining entries in the spectral sequence follow from the vanishing of higher spin cobordism groups and the known cohomology of $BG_2$. For $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$, the rational homology gives $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^2$, though torsion may also be present. Looking at the cohomology ring $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2[w_4, w_6, w_7]$, I can determine $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ by examining the monomials in these degrees.\n\nFor degree 10, the only monomial is $w_4 w_6$ since $4 + 6 = 10$, giving $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. In degree 11, I need to check $w_4 w_7$ and other combinations.\n\n$w_4 w_7$ has degree $4 + 7 = 11$, and there are no other monomials of this degree, so $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ as well. To relate cohomology to homology, I should use the universal coefficient theorem rather than Poincaré duality, since $BG_2$ isn't a finite-dimensional manifold. The UCT applies here since $BG_2$ has finitely generated homology in each degree. k), k) \\cong H^n(X; k)$ for field coefficients.\n\nThis means $H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H_{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. So the spectral sequence terms are $E_2^{10,2} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $E_2^{11,1} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nNow I need to track the differentials $d_r: E_r^{p,q} \\to E_r^{p-r, q+r-1}$. The $d_2$ differential from $E_2^{10,2}$ maps to $E_2^{8,3} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_3^{Spin}) = 0$, so this differential vanishes. However, $d_2: E_2^{11,1} \\to E_2^{9,2}$ maps to $H_9(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin}) = H_9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, which is potentially nonzero.\n\nTo determine $H_9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, I need to find monomials in the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_4, w_6, w_7$ that have total degree 9. Checking the possibilities: $w_4^2$ has degree 8, products like $w_6 w_3$ or $w_7 w_2$ don't exist since those classes aren't available. For combinations $4a + 6b + 7c = 9$ with nonnegative integers, the case $c = 1$ gives $4a + 6b = 2$, which has no solutions.\n\nThe case $c = 0$ requires $4a + 6b = 9$, also impossible. This means $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$, so $H_9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$. The differential $d_2$ acting on $E_2^{11,1}$ therefore vanishes since its target is zero.\n\nFor the next differential, I'm looking at $d_3: E_3^{10,2} \\to E_3^{7,4}$, where the target is $H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTo find this, I note that $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ (generated by $w_7$) while $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, which means $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is purely torsion. Using the universal coefficient theorem with $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ being torsion-free (since $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$), I can determine that $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$. There are no monomials in $w_6$ or $w_7$ of the required degrees, so $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ generated by $w_4^2$. Using the universal coefficient theorem, I need to account for torsion from $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$, but since $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$, the higher cohomology group must be torsion-free. Now for $H^7$: the mod 2 cohomology decomposes as $T_7 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2$ since there's no torsion contribution from $H^8$. This forces $T_7$ to contain a $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ summand. I should check whether there's odd torsion as well—the homotopy group $\\pi_7(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/3$ might constrain this via Hurewicz.\n\nSince the rationalization of $BG_2$ matches $K(\\mathbb{Z}, 4) \\times K(\\mathbb{Z}, 12)$, I can analyze 2-torsion and 3-torsion independently. The mod 3 cohomology is a polynomial algebra $\\mathbb{Z}/3[y_4, y_{12}]$ concentrated in degrees divisible by 4 and 12, so degree 7 gets no contribution from 3-torsion. Therefore $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nFor the homology, I need to apply the universal coefficient theorem: $H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ comes from $\\text{Ext}(H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\text{Hom}(H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSince $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, we get $\\text{Hom}(\\mathbb{Z}/2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. And $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ gives $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This means $H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nBut I should double-check using the other form of the UCT with tensor products and Tor instead. $\\text{Hom}(H_7(BG_2), \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ since $H_7(BG_2)$ is finite, which follows from $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. This gives $\\text{Ext}(H_6(BG_2), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, meaning the torsion subgroup of $H_6(BG_2)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. From the mod 2 cohomology, $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ comes from the Stiefel-Whitney class $w_6$.\n\nSince $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, the integral cohomology $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is purely torsion. Using the universal coefficient theorem, $H_5(BG_2)$ must be either trivial or torsion since $H^5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. Checking mod 2 cohomology, there are no degree 5 monomials in the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_4, w_6, w_7$, so $H^5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$.\n\nSimilarly, $H^5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ because the polynomial algebra $\\mathbb{Z}/3[y_4, y_{12}]$ has no elements in degree 5. This means $H^5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ entirely. The UCT then gives $\\text{Ext}(H_4, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ since $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $H^5$ vanishes, the UCT sequence becomes $0 \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to \\text{Hom}(H_5, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$, which means $\\text{Hom}(H_5, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This tells me $H_5$ must be purely torsion or trivial, but doesn't uniquely determine it. I need to approach this differently using the structure of $BG_2$ itself.\n\nSince $BG_2$ is 3-connected, the first nonzero homology appears at $H_4(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$. For the next degree, the Hurewicz theorem in this range gives $\\pi_5(BG_2) \\to H_5(BG_2)$, but $\\pi_5(BG_2) = \\pi_4(G_2) = 0$, so this doesn't immediately determine $H_5$. I need to use deeper structural properties of the classifying space.\n\nThe universal $G_2$ bundle $G_2 \\to EG_2 \\to BG_2$ provides a Serre spectral sequence with $E_2^{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; H_q(G_2)) \\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(EG_2)$. Since $EG_2$ is contractible, the target is just $\\mathbb{Z}$ in degree 0 and 0 elsewhere. This spectral sequence constrains the homology of $BG_2$ based on the known homology of $G_2$.\n\nFor $G_2$ itself, the integral homology is concentrated in degrees 0, 3, and 11 (where it's $\\mathbb{Z}$), with vanishing groups in degrees 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10. Degree 6 contains 2-torsion arising from the Steenrod square $Sq^3$ applied to the generator in degree 3.\n\nThe cohomology ring is more structured: generators appear in degrees 0, 3, 6, 11, and 14, where degree 6 is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ and the others are $\\mathbb{Z}$. All other cohomology groups vanish. Since $G_2$ is a 14-dimensional manifold, Poincaré duality relates the homology and cohomology groups accordingly.\n\nThis gives me the homology groups: $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_3 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_8 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $H_{11} = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_{14} = \\mathbb{Z}$. Now I need to apply the Serre spectral sequence for the universal bundle $G_2 \\to EG_2 \\to BG_2$ to compute the cohomology of the classifying space.\n\nThe $E_2$ page has $E_2^{p,q} = H_p(BG_2) \\otimes H_q(G_2)$, and this must converge to $H_*(EG_2) = 0$ (since the total space is contractible). The transgression maps should give isomorphisms: $H_3(G_2) \\to H_4(BG_2)$ and $H_{11}(G_2) \\to H_{12}(BG_2)$. The $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ component in $H_8(G_2)$ requires careful analysis of how it interacts with the differentials.\n\nIn the Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $G_2 \\to EG_2 \\to BG_2$, the transgression $\\tau: H_n(G_2) \\to H_{n+1}(BG_2)$ arises as a differential on the $E_2$ page. Since $EG_2$ is contractible, all classes must eventually be killed by these differentials, so the transgressions need to account for the entire homology of the fiber.\n\nFor the generator $x_3 \\in H_3(G_2)$, we have $\\tau(x_3) = y_4$, establishing a fundamental relation between the fiber and base. The torsion element $z_8 \\in H_8(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ must also be transgressed: $\\tau(z_8) \\in H_9(BG_2)$. For the spectral sequence to converge properly to $H_*(pt)$, this transgression needs to be non-zero and contribute to killing off the torsion in the base space's homology.\n\nLooking at the cohomology with coefficients, $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$ and $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$, which suggests $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ vanishes. However, $\\pi_9(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/6$ could introduce odd torsion factors beyond just 3-torsion that affect the homology computation.\n\nThe Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $G_2 \\to EG_2 \\to BG_2$ must converge to $H_*(pt)$, meaning every homology class in $G_2$ gets killed by differentials or transgressions. The generator in $H_3(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ transgresses to $H_4(BG_2)$, the $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ in $H_8(G_2)$ transgresses to $H_9(BG_2)$, and the generator in $H_{11}(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}$ transgresses to $H_{12}(BG_2)$. For these transgressions to occur properly, $H_9(BG_2)$ must contain a $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ summand to receive the transgression from $H_8(G_2)$.\n\nHowever, checking the cohomology: monomials in $w_4, w_6, w_7$ with total degree 9 would require $4a + 6b + 7c = 9$. When $c = 1$, we get $4a + 6b = 2$ with no non-negative integer solutions; when $c = 0$, we get $4a + 6b = 9$ which also has no solutions. So $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$, which contradicts what the spectral sequence requires.\n\nThis suggests the $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ in $H_8(G_2)$ must be eliminated through a different mechanism. The transgression alone can't account for it, so I need to examine the Serre spectral sequence more carefully. Looking at $E_2^{p,q} = H_p(BG_2; H_q(G_2))$, the page contains $E_2^{0,0} = \\mathbb{Z}$ from $H_0(G_2)$, $E_2^{0,3} = \\mathbb{Z}$ from $H_3(G_2)$, and $E_2^{0,8} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ from the 8-dimensional homology.\n\nThe transgression $d_4: E_4^{0,3} \\to E_4^{4,0}$ acts as an isomorphism between the two $\\mathbb{Z}$ summands, killing both $E_5^{0,3}$ and $E_5^{4,0}$. But the $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ at $E_2^{0,8}$ requires a separate differential to vanish.\n\nIf $H_9(BG_2) = 0$, then the potential transgression $d_9: E_9^{0,8} \\to E_9^{9,0}$ would be zero, allowing $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ to persist through $E_{10}$. This means I need to find another differential that targets this class. The candidates are differentials of the form $d_r: E_r^{r, 9-r} \\to E_r^{0,8}$ for various $r \\geq 2$, with the $r=2$ case being $d_2: E_2^{2,7} \\to E_2^{0,8}$.\n\nSince $H_2(BG_2) = 0$, the term $E_2^{2,7} = H_2(BG_2; H_7(G_2))$ vanishes. Similarly, $E_2^{3,6}$ vanishes because $H_3(BG_2; H_6(G_2)) = 0$. For $r=4$, I'm checking whether $E_2^{4,5} = H_4(BG_2; H_5(G_2))$ provides a source.\n\nMost of these cohomology groups of $G_2$ are trivial—specifically $H_q(G_2) = 0$ for $q \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13\\}$. This means the only potential differential that could eliminate $E^{0,8}$ is $d_9$, which would require $H_9(BG_2)$ to have 2-torsion to work.\n\nBut this creates a problem with my earlier claim that $H_9(BG_2)$ is torsion-free. I need to reconsider the structure of $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$. Perhaps it's not simply $\\mathbb{Z}/2[w_4, w_6, w_7]$ as I assumed. Looking at the mod 2 cohomology of $G_2$ itself more carefully, the structure is more intricate than I initially thought, particularly regarding the 2-primary torsion in the homotopy groups. x_3, x_{11}]/(x_3^4, x_{11}^2)$ with some relation.\n\nLooking at dimensions: $\\dim G_2 = 14$, so the top cohomology class lives in $H^{14}$. With $x_3 \\in H^3$ and $x_{11} \\in H^{11}$, I need to find which monomials fit. The product $x_3^2 x_{11}$ lands in $H^{17}$, which overshoots. Let me check $x_3 x_{11}$ instead, which would be in $H^{\n\n14}$ — that's exactly the top degree.\n\nUsing Poincaré duality, $H^k \\cong H^{14-k}$ for $G_2$. This means $H^0 \\cong H^{14}$ (both $\\mathbb{Z}/2$), and the cohomology ring must respect this pairing. The structure should be $\\mathbb{Z}/2[x_3]/(x_3^5) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2[x_{11}]/(x_{11}^2)$, though I need to verify the exponents match the dimension constraints and duality requirements. $2$\n$H^{14} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n\nThese cohomology groups are related through the cup product structure. The algebra isn't simply a free exterior algebra on generators—there are relations coming from Steenrod squares. Testing whether $H^*(G_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ could be generated by $x_3, x_5, x_6, x_{11}$ with relations like $x_5 = Sq^2 x_3$ and $x_6 = Sq^3 x_3$ doesn't work because it would make $x_5$ and $x_6$ dependent on $x_3$ alone. Instead, the structure appears to be an exterior algebra on three generators $y_3, y_5, y_{11}$ with the relation $y_5 = Sq^2 y_3$.\n\nThis gives: degree 0 is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$, degree 3 is generated by $y_3$, degree 5 by $y_5 = Sq^2 y_3$, degree 6 by $Sq^1 y_5$, degree 8 by $y_3 y_5$, degree 11 by $y_{11}$, and degree 14 by $y_3 y_{11}$. But Poincaré duality imposes constraints—it requires $H^8 \\cong H^6$ and $H^9 \\cong H^5$, which suggests the cohomology ring has additional structure I need to account for.\n\nLooking this up, the cohomology is actually $H^*(G_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\Lambda(x_3, x_5, x_6)$ with Steenrod operations $Sq^2 x_3 = x_5$ and $Sq^1 x_5 = x_6$. So the generators sit in degrees 3, 5, and 6 respectively, with the exterior algebra structure giving the full ring.\n\nThe higher degree classes come from products: $H^8$ contains $x_3 x_5$, $H^9$ has $x_3 x_6$, $H^{11}$ has $x_5 x_6$, and the top degree $H^{14}$ contains $x_3 x_5 x_6$.\n\nFor the fibration $G_2 \\to EG_2 \\to BG_2$, the Serre spectral sequence with $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ coefficients shows transgressions mapping the generators to Stiefel-Whitney classes in the base: $\\tau(x_3) = w_4$ and $\\tau(x_5)$ gives another class in $H^*(BG_2)$.\n\nSince $x_5 = Sq^2 x_3$ in the fiber, the transgression relation carries through to the base via naturality. The Adem relations then determine how the Steenrod squares interact with these classes, giving me the complete structure of $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ generated by these Stiefel-Whitney classes.\n\nThe spectral sequence's $E_2$ page decomposes as a tensor product of the base and fiber cohomologies. The key differentials are $d_4(1 \\otimes x_3) = w_4 \\otimes 1$, $d_6(1 \\otimes x_5) = w_6 \\otimes 1$, and $d_7(1 \\otimes x_6) = w_7 \\otimes 1$, which systematically eliminate the fiber generators while introducing the base classes. Higher products involving these generators also get killed by subsequent differentials.\n\nFor products like $x_3 x_5$, I need to apply the Leibniz rule carefully—the differential $d_4(1 \\otimes x_3 x_5)$ would give $w_4 \\otimes x_5$ if $d_4$ acts on $x_5$, but I should check the bidegrees. In a fibration where the total space is contractible, the transgression map relates cohomology classes between the fiber and base, which is the mechanism driving these differentials.\n\nWith mod 2 coefficients and the algebra structure, the Leibniz rule governs how differentials act on products. The key differentials are $d_4: E_4^{0,3} \\to E_4^{4,0}$, $d_6: E_6^{0,5} \\to E_6^{6,0}$, and $d_7: E_7^{0,6} \\to E_7^{7,0}$. I should compute the $E_2$ page first to see what classes are present and how they interact under these differentials.\n\nThe transgression $\\tau(x_3) = w_4$ tells me that $d_4(1 \\otimes x_3) = w_4 \\otimes 1$. After applying $d_4$, the class $x_3$ becomes a boundary, so $E_5^{0,3} = 0$. The class $w_4$ appears as the image of this differential, and I need to track how it persists or gets killed by higher differentials.\n\nThe mod 2 cohomology ring of $BG_2$ is generated by $w_4, w_6, w_7$ where $w_6 = Sq^2 w_4$ and $w_7 = Sq^3 w_4$. These Steenrod operations impose constraints on the structure—I should check whether these relations force $H^*(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ to be a polynomial algebra or if there are additional relations among the generators. the verification involves checking what relations exist among these generators. In degree 8, $w_4^2$ stands alone since $w_6$ has degree 6 and $w_7$ has degree 7, so no product of lower-degree generators reaches degree 8. Moving to degree 12, both $w_4^3$ and $w_6^2$ appear, along with $w_4 w_6$ in degree 10 and $w_4^2 w_6$ in degree 14, suggesting potential relations need to be examined at this level.\n\nThe mod 2 cohomology ring is a polynomial algebra $\\mathbb{Z}/2[w_4, w_6, w_7]$ with no relations among these generators. For integral cohomology, the structure shifts—$H^4(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by a class $c_4$, indicating the presence of characteristic classes that don't reduce to simple polynomial generators over the integers. Since $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, the integral cohomology $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ must be entirely torsion. Similarly, $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion since its rational version vanishes. However, $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$ indicates that $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ contains a free component.\n\nLooking at the Bockstein operations and how Steenrod squares relate the mod 2 classes: if $w_6 = Sq^2 w_4$ and $w_4$ lifts from an integral class $c_4$, it's unclear whether $w_6$ itself admits an integral lift. The Bockstein $\\beta = Sq^1$ provides constraints on which mod 2 classes can come from torsion in the integral cohomology.\n\nSince $w_7 = Sq^1 w_6$, we have $\\beta(w_6) = w_7 \\neq 0$. This obstruction means $w_6$ cannot lift to an integral class. Instead, there exists a 2-torsion element $\\xi \\in H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ satisfying $2\\xi = 0$ with $\\xi \\bmod 2 = w_7$, capturing the relationship between the mod 2 reduction and the integral structure. = w_7$ means the Bockstein of $w_6$ reduces to $w_7 \\mod 2$.\n\nThis gives us $\\beta(w_6) = \\zeta_7 \\in H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ where $\\zeta_7 \\mod 2 = w_7$ and $2\\zeta_7 = 0$. The mod 3 cohomology vanishes in degree 7, ruling out any 3-torsion, so $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is purely 2-torsion.\n\nFor degree 6, the class $w_6$ generates $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, but since $\\beta(w_6) = \\zeta_7 \\neq 0$, it cannot lift to an integral class. The Bockstein sequence $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\mod 2} H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\xrightarrow{\\beta} H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ constrains what torsion can appear in $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSince $\\beta$ is injective on $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, the reduction map from integral cohomology must be trivial, meaning $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ contains only torsion.\n\nChecking torsion: $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ eliminates 3-torsion, and the mod 2 reduction being zero eliminates 2-torsion. Therefore $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nFor the homology group, the universal coefficient theorem gives $H^6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(H_6, \\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{Ext}(H_5, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the cohomology vanishes, if $H_5 = 0$ then $\\text{Ext}(H_5, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $H_6$ must also be zero.\n\nVerifying $H_5 = 0$: there are no degree 5 monomials in the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_4, w_6, w_7$ over $\\mathbb{Z}/2$, and similarly $H^5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$, so $H^5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ by UCT.\n\nThis confirms $H_6$ is torsion with $\\text{Hom}(H_6, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, and the cohomological UCT shows $\\text{Ext}(H_5, \\mathbb{Z})$ vanishes as well.\n\nNow applying the Bockstein sequence: since $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H_5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, the map from $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ to $H_5(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ is zero, which constrains the structure of $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe quotient $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) / 2 H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$ tells me there's 2-torsion present. Combined with the vanishing of $\\text{Hom}(H_6, \\mathbb{Z})$, which eliminates any free component, this pins down the group structure.\n\nSince $H_6/2H_6 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, the group must be cyclic 2-torsion of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2^a$ for some $a \\geq 1$. Without additional constraints to determine the exact exponent, I'll work with $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nFor $H_7$, the universal coefficient theorem gives $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Ext}(H_6, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Hom}(H_7, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}/2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H_7$ is torsion (so $\\text{Hom}(H_7, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$), we have $H^7 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. The vanishing of $H^7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q})$ indicates that $H_7$ is entirely torsion.\n\nLooking at the Bockstein sequence in mod 2 homology, $H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ from the Stiefel-Whitney class $w_7$. The long exact sequence from the coefficient sequence $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{2} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to 0$ connects these groups through multiplication by 2.\n\nThe map $H_7(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_7(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ has image equal to $H_7(\\mathbb{Z})/2H_7(\\mathbb{Z})$. If $H_7(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, then the induced map $\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to H_6(\\mathbb{Z})$ becomes injective, which is consistent since $H_6(\\mathbb{Z})$ contains 2-torsion. The Bockstein connecting map $\\beta_*: H_7(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H_6(\\mathbb{Z})$ lowers degree as the connecting homomorphism in the long exact sequence.\n\nIf $\\beta_*$ sends the generator $w_7$ to a nonzero element, then $w_7$ doesn't lift to an integral class and $H_6$ must have 2-torsion. This is the homological dual of the cohomological Bockstein relation $\\beta(w_6) = w_7$ that raises degree. So far I've established that $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ contains $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ might vanish. Let me check $H_7(BG_2$\n\n; $\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ using the universal coefficient theorem. Since $H^8 = \\mathbb{Z}$ (generated by $c_4^2$) and $H_7$ is torsion, the decomposition $H^8 = \\text{Ext}(H_7, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Hom}(H_8, \\mathbb{Z})$ gives $\\mathbb{Z} = \\text{Ext}(H_7, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. This forces $\\text{Ext}(H_7, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, meaning $H_7$ is torsion-free, so $H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nFrom $H^7 = \\mathbb{Z}/2 = \\text{Ext}(H_6, \\mathbb{Z})$, I can deduce that $H_6$ has $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ torsion. Since $H^6 = 0$, there's no free part, giving $H_6(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. For $H_8$, the rational cohomology $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}$ indicates free rank 1.\n\nLooking at the mod 2 cohomology, $H^8(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ from the $w_4^2$ term. The vanishing of $H^9$ in both mod 2 and mod 3 cohomology means $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Since $H_8$ contains a free $\\mathbb{Z}$ summand, the Ext term $\\text{Ext}(H_8, \\mathbb{Z})$ vanishes, so any torsion in $H_8$ must come from the Hom part of the universal coefficient formula.\n\nThe fact that $H^9 = 0$ forces both $\\text{Ext}(H_8, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $\\text{Hom}(H_9, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which means $H_8$ is torsion-free and $H_9$ is purely torsion. The vanishing of $H^9$ in mod 2 coefficients eliminates the 2-primary torsion component of $H_9$.\n\nSimilarly, $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ kills the 3-primary part. Since $\\pi_9(G_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/6$, this gives $\\pi_{10}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/6$, but I need to connect this to the homology directly. The Hurewicz theorem applies when $BG_2$ is sufficiently connected—it establishes $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}$ from $\\pi_4 = \\mathbb{Z}$, and the Hurewicz map $\\pi_n(BG_2) \\to H_n$ determines higher homology groups in certain ranges.\n\nLooking at the cohomology data: $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ (generated by $w_4 w_6$), $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$, and $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. This means $H^{10}$ is purely 2-torsion. By universal coefficients, $H^{10}$ relates to $\\text{Ext}(H_9, \\mathbb{Z})$, and the vanishing of $H^{10}$ in odd primes combined with the cohomology pattern suggests $H_9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nThe Bockstein map $\\beta: H^9(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$ should detect the 2-torsion in degree 10, but since $H^9(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$, this map is trivial.\n\nLooking instead at $\\beta: H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})$, I have $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cdot w_4 w_6$ and $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cdot w_4 w_7$. Computing the Bockstein on the generator: $\\beta(w_4 w_6) = \\beta(w_4) w_6 + w_4 \\beta(w_6)$, where $\\beta(w_4) = 0$ and $\\beta(w_6) = \\zeta_7$ (the integral lift of $w_7$).\n\nWait, I'm mixing up the Bockstein with the Steenrod square. The relation is $Sq^1 = \\beta \\bmod 2$. Applying $Sq^1$ instead: $Sq^1(w_4 w_6) = Sq^1(w_4) w_6 + w_4 Sq^1(w_6) = 0 + w_4 w_7 = w_4 w_7 \\neq 0$. This means $\\beta(w_4 w_6)$ is nonzero in integral cohomology, so the class $w_4 w_6$ doesn't vanish under the Bockstein.\n\nNow for $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$. The long exact sequence from the universal coefficient theorem gives $H^9(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^9(\\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\bmod 2} H^9(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\xrightarrow{\\beta} H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H^9(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, the Bockstein map $\\beta: H^9(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is injective. I need to check what happens with the rest of the sequence involving $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe continuation shows $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{2} H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\xrightarrow{\\beta} H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})$. The Bockstein $\\beta: \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cdot w_4 w_6 \\to H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is injective since $\\beta(w_4 w_6) = w_4 \\zeta_7 \\neq 0$. This means the kernel of $\\beta$ on $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ is trivial, so $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})/2H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, implying $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is 2-divisible.\n\nSince $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion (as $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$), it must be a 2-power torsion group that's divisible by 2, which forces $H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. From the universal coefficient theorem, $0 = \\text{Ext}(H_9, \\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{Hom}(H_{10}, \\mathbb{Z})$, so $H_9$ is torsion-free and $H_{10}$ has no free part.\n\nChecking cohomology with coefficients: $H^9(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = 0$ means $H_9$ has no 2-torsion, and $H^9(\\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ means no 3-torsion, so $H_9 = 0$. For $H_{10}$, the Bockstein sequence gives $H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta_*} H_9(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, making the map to $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ surjective.\n\nThis means $H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z})/2H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. Since there's no free part, $H_{10}$ must be a finite 2-torsion group, specifically $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. Now I need to check $H_{11}$ and $H_{12}$ using the cohomology ring—$H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ is generated by $w_4 w_7$, and I should compute the mod 3 cohomology as well.\n\n$H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ and $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, so all torsion in degree 11 is 2-primary. To understand the structure, I'll apply the Steenrod square $Sq^1$ to $w_4 w_7$. Since $w_4$ lifts to an integral class $c_4$, we have $Sq^1(w_4) = 0$. For $w_7$, I can use the relation $w_7 = Sq^1 w_6$ to compute $Sq^1(w_7)$.\n\nSince $Sq^1 \\circ Sq^1 = 0$, we get $Sq^1(w_7) = 0$, which means $Sq^1(w_4 w_7) = 0$. This tells me the Bockstein $\\beta(w_4 w_7)$ is even. If $\\beta(w_4 w_7) = 0$, then $w_4 w_7$ admits an integral lift, but since $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, any such lift must be torsion. I should examine the Bockstein sequence to determine the exact torsion structure. w_7) \\neq 0$ in $H^{12}(\\mathbb{Z})$ but is 2-divisible, that's a contradiction since $H^{12}(\\mathbb{Z})$ has a free part $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nSo $\\beta(w_4 w_7) = 0$, meaning $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ contains $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. The Bockstein map into a free abelian group must vanish since it only produces torsion elements, so $\\beta$ is trivial on this class.\n\nThis means $w_4 w_7$ lifts to a 2-torsion element $\\xi_{11} \\in H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$. Using the universal coefficient theorem, I can determine that $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2^a$ for some $a \\geq 1$, where the torsion comes from $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}/2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ applied to the homology in degree 10.\n\nSince $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, the homology $H_{11}$ must be entirely torsion, which eliminates any free contribution. Therefore $H^{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nFor the next degree, the rational cohomology $H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}^2$ tells me that $H_{12}$ has rank 2. The integral cohomology splits into contributions from the free part of $H_{12}$ and the torsion in $H_{11}$. Since $H_{11}$ is torsion, it contributes via the Ext functor, while the free rank of $H_{12}$ contributes directly to $H^{12}$.\n\nLooking at the Bockstein sequence, I have $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ mapping to $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. The map $\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$ is either trivial or an isomorphism. If it's an isomorphism, then the Bockstein $\\beta: H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{12}(\\mathbb{Z})$ must be injective, which constrains the structure of $H^{12}$.\n\nSince I computed $\\beta(w_4 w_7) = 0$, the Bockstein vanishes entirely, so the map $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})/2 \\to H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ is surjective. This means $H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ receives no contribution from the Bockstein, leaving only the Ext and Hom terms. For the cohomology to match expected dimensions, I need $H_{12} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nNow I should verify whether $H^{12}$ contains any torsion. The mod 2 cohomology shows $H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cdot w_4^3 + \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cdot w_6^2$. Both generators should lift to integral classes—$w_4^3$ comes from $c_4^3$, and for $w_6^2$, since $w_6 = Sq^2 w_4$, I have $(Sq^2 w_4)^2 = Sq^4(w_4^2)$ in mod 2 cohomology.\n\nThe question is whether $w_6^2$ itself lifts integrally. Since $w_6 = Sq^2 c_4 \\pmod{2}$, the Steenrod square operation on an integral class doesn't necessarily yield an integral operation. Using Bockstein calculations, $Sq^1(w_6^2) = 0 \\pmod{2}$, which suggests $w_6^2$ might lift to an integral class without torsion.\n\nTo check this more carefully, I need to examine the Bockstein map $\\beta: H^{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, any element in $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z})$ must be torsion. The generators in degree 13 come from monomials $w_4^a w_6^b w_7^c$ where $4a + 6b + 7c = 13$. The possible combinations are $a=0, b=1, c=1$ or $a=1, b=0, c=\\frac{9}{7}$ (impossible), so the only generator is $w_6 w_7$.\n\nNow, if $\\beta(w_6^2) \\neq 0$, then $w_6^2$ wouldn't lift to an integral class. Computing the Steenrod square: $Sq^1(w_6^2) = 2w_6 Sq^1(w_6) = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ coefficients, which constrains what $\\beta(w_6^2)$ can be.\n\nSince $\\beta(w_6^2)$ must be 2-torsion and $\\beta(w_6^2) \\bmod 2 = 0$, this forces $\\beta(w_6^2) = 0$. So $w_6^2$ does lift integrally, even though $w_6$ itself doesn't. Similarly, $\\beta(w_4^3) = 0$ since $\\beta(w_4) = 0$. The apparent paradox—that $w_6$ fails to lift but $w_6^2$ succeeds—resolves because they lift to different integral classes; there's no requirement that the square of an integral lift of $w_6$ equals an integral lift of $w_6^2$.\n\nIn $H^{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$, the class $w_6^2$ comes from an integral class $\\chi_{12} \\in H^{12}(\\mathbb{Z})$. This means $H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ contains at least $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $c_4^3$ and $\\chi_{12}$ (or a related class capturing $w_6^2$ mod 2). Assuming no 2-torsion appears in degree 12, the integral cohomology is determined by these generators.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check whether $H_{11}$ is torsion-free. Using the universal coefficient theorem, $H^{12} = \\text{Ext}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{Hom}(H_{12}, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\text{Hom}(H_{12}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, having $H^{12} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ requires $\\text{Ext}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, meaning $H_{11}$ must be free. But $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ from earlier calculations, which constrains what $H_{11}$ can be.\n\nApplying the universal coefficient theorem to $H^{11}$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2 = \\text{Ext}(H_{10}, \\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{Hom}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_{10} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, we get $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}/2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, so $\\text{Hom}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This means $H_{11}$ is entirely torsion. The 2-torsion in $H_{11}$ would then contribute to $\\text{Ext}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z})$, creating a contradiction with the requirement that $\\text{Ext}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nTherefore $H_{11} = 0$. I can check this using the Bockstein sequence: $H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{2} H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\xrightarrow{\\beta_*} H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$, where the map $\\beta_*: \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z})$ must be injective since $H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. w_6) = $ image in $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSince $Sq^1(w_4 w_6) = w_4 w_7 \\neq 0$, we have $\\beta(w_4 w_6) \\mod 2 = w_4 w_7 \\neq 0$, so $\\beta(w_4 w_6)$ is nonzero in $H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})$. This means $\\beta: H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{11}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is surjective since both groups are $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ and the image is nontrivial. By the exact sequence,\n$\\ker(\\beta) = \\text{Im}(H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2))$. Since $H^{10}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, the kernel vanishes, making $\\beta$ injective as well. Therefore $\\beta: \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$ is an isomorphism. Now for the homology Bockstein:\n$\\beta_*: H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H_{10}(\\mathbb{\n\nZ})$ is dual to the cohomological $\\beta$. Since the cohomological version is an isomorphism, duality ensures the homological $\\beta_*$ is also an isomorphism. This gives $H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) / 2 H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\ker(\\beta_*) = 0$, which forces $H_{11}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. So $H_{11}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nFor $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$, I use the UCT with $H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The universal coefficient theorem gives $H^{12} = \\text{Ext}(H_{11}, \\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{Hom}(H_{12}, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_{11} = 0$, the Ext term vanishes, leaving $\\text{Hom}(H_{12}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. This means $H_{12}$ has rank 2 as a free abelian group. Any torsion would appear in the Ext term.\n\nLooking at $H^{13}$: the rational cohomology vanishes, but mod 2 I have $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cdot w_6 w_7$. Computing the Steenrod square, $Sq^1(w_6 w_7) = w_7^2$ (since $Sq^1(w_6) = w_7$ and $Sq^1(w_7) = 0$). The Bockstein map gives $\\beta(w_6 w_7) \\equiv w_7^2 \\pmod{2}$, which lives in degree 14.\n\nFor degree 14 monomials, I need $4a + 6b + 7c = 14$. When $c = 2$, this forces $a = b = 0$, giving $w_7^2$. When $c = 0$, I get $a = 2, b = 1$, yielding $w_4^2 w_6$. So $H^{14}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ generated by these two classes, and the Bockstein image of $w_6 w_7$ is indeed $w_7^2$.\n\nSince $H^{14}(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, the group $H^{14}(\\mathbb{Z})$ must be entirely torsion. The Bockstein map sends the generator of $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ to a non-zero element in this torsion group, which means $w_6 w_7$ cannot be lifted to an integral cohomology class. Looking at the long exact sequence in cohomology, the reduction map $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and the Bockstein connecting homomorphism determine whether elements have integral lifts.\n\nSince $\\beta$ is injective (it maps $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ into a torsion group), its kernel is trivial, so the image of reduction mod 2 must also be zero. This means no element of $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z})$ reduces to $w_6 w_7$ modulo 2. Combined with $H^{13}(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, this forces $H^{13}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nThe map $\\text{Ext}(H_{12}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\hookrightarrow H^{13}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ shows $H_{12}$ is torsion-free, so $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The homology groups are: $H_0 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_4 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_6 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $H_7 = 0$, $H_8 = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_9 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n\n, $H_{10} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $H_{11} = 0$, and $H_{12} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. Now I need to examine the AHSS for $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$, starting with the $E_2$ page terms $E_2^{p, 12-p}$ where $p > 0$. The term $E_2^{4,8} = H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_8^{Spin})$ factors as $H_4(BG_2) \\otimes \\Omega_8^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\Omega_8^{Spin}$.\n\nContinuing with the remaining terms: $E_2^{6,6}$ vanishes since $\\Omega_6^{Spin} = 0$. For $E_2^{8,4}$, I get $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. The term $E_2^{10,2}$ gives $\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. Finally, $E_2^{12,0}$ involves $H_{12}(BG_2)$.\n\nThe remaining entries are zero. Now I need to examine the differentials. For $d_2: E_2^{4,8} \\to E_2^{2,9}$, the target is zero since $H_2(BG_2) = 0$, so this differential vanishes. For $d_2: E_2^{8,4} \\to E_2^{6,5}$, the target is $H_6(BG_2; \\Omega_5^{Spin}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\otimes$\n\nI need to complete this thought from the next thinking:\n\n0 = 0$, so this also vanishes. Similarly, $d_2: E_2^{10,2} \\to E_2^{8,3}$ maps to $H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_3^{Spin}) = 0$, giving another zero differential. However, $d_2: E_2^{12,0} \\to E_2^{10,1}$ is potentially non-trivial since the target $H_{10}(BG_2; \\Omega_1^{Spin}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ is non-zero. The behavior of this differential in the AHSS requires careful analysis.\n\nIn the Spin bordism spectral sequence, the $d_2$ differential corresponds to the operation $Sq^2 + w_2 \\cdot$. Since $G_2 \\subset Spin(7)$, we have $w_2(BG_2) = 0$, so the differential reduces to just $Sq^2$. For the map from $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ to $H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$, I need to determine whether this Steenrod square operation produces a non-zero result. n-2, k+1}$\n\nThe differential in the Spin bordism spectral sequence takes $H_n(X; \\Omega_k^{Spin})$ to $H_{n-2}(X; \\Omega_{k+1}^{Spin})$, which involves understanding how the $MSpin$ spectrum's structure induces operations on homology. For $MSpin$, the first $k$-invariant plays a key role in determining these differentials.\n\nRather than pursuing this abstract route, I should examine whether the spectral sequence collapses due to dimensional constraints. Checking the $d_3$ differential: it maps from $E_3^{12,0}$ to $E_3^{9,2}$, but since $H_9(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin}) = 0$, this differential vanishes automatically.\n\nSimilarly, $d_4$ and $d_5$ both target zero groups—$H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_3^{Spin})$ and $H_7(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{Spin})$ respectively—so they're forced to be zero. This pattern continues, meaning the $E_2$ term survives to the $E_\\infty$ page in bidegree $(12,0)$.\n\nNow I need to check whether $d_2: E_2^{12,0} \\to E_2^{10,1}$ actually vanishes. The source is $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and the target is $H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. The $d_2$ differential involves Bockstein-type operations, and determining whether a class in $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ maps nontrivially requires understanding the specific cohomological structure.\n\nSince $G_2 \\subset Spin(7)$, the integral Stiefel-Whitney class $W_3 = \\beta(w_2)$ vanishes on $BG_2$. This suggests that $d_2$ might be trivial on the integer cohomology part, so I'll proceed assuming $d_2 = 0$ on $E_2^{*,0}$.\n\nWith this assumption, the $E_3$ page has $E_3^{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $E_3^{8,4} = \\mathbb{Z}$, $E_3^{10,2} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, and $E_3^{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. For the $d_3$ differential, the target $E_3^{1,10}$ vanishes since it corresponds to $H_1(BG_2; \\Omega_{10}^{Spin}) = 0$, so $d_3$ is zero there. I need to check whether $d_3: E_3^{8,4} \\to E_3^{5,6}$ contributes anything meaningful.\n\nThe map $d_3: E_3^{8,4} \\to E_3^{5,6}$ also targets a vanishing group since $H_5(BG_2; \\Omega_6^{Spin}) = 0$. Similarly, $d_3: E_3^{10,2} \\to E_3^{7,4}$ maps to zero because $H_7(BG_2; \\Omega_4^{Spin}) = 0$, and $d_3: E_3^{12,0} \\to E_3^{9,2}$ is trivial as well. So all $d_3$ differentials vanish. For $d_4$, I examine $d_4: E_4^{4,8} \\to E_4^{0,11}$, which maps into $H_0(BG_2; \\Omega_{11}^{Spin})$.\n\nSince $\\Omega_{11}^{Spin} = 0$, this differential is zero. The map $d_4: E_4^{8,4} \\to E_4^{4,7}$ targets $H_4(BG_2; \\Omega_7^{Spin}) = 0$, and $d_4: E_4^{10,2} \\to E_4^{6,5}$ and $d_4: E_4^{12,0} \\to E_4^{8,3}$ both vanish as well. For $d_5$, I need to check $d_5: E_5^{4,8} \\to E_5^{-1,12}$\n\n, which has negative target degree so it's zero. The remaining $d_5$ differentials also vanish since their targets are trivial. Higher differentials follow the same pattern and disappear, so the spectral sequence stabilizes at $E_2$ or possibly $E_3$ depending on whether certain $d_2$ differentials are nonzero.\n\nLet me verify $d_2: E_2^{10,2} \\to E_2^{8,3}$ more carefully. The target is $H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_3^{Spin}) = 0$, so this differential is zero. The only $d_2$ that could potentially be nontrivial is $d_2: E_2^{12,0} \\to E_2^{10,1}$, where $E_2^{10,1} = H_{10}(BG_2; \\Omega_1^{Spin}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$\n\n. Since the source is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and the target is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$, the differential is determined by where it sends the two generators. If $d_2$ vanishes, then $E_\\infty^{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $E_\\infty^{10,1} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. If $d_2$ is nonzero, the kernel gives $E_3^{12,0}$, which could be all of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ or a proper subgroup depending on the map's image.\n\nSince a torsion-free group mapping to $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ has image either trivial or all of $\\mathbb{Z}/2$, the kernel is either the full domain or has index 2.\n\nIf $d_2$ is nonzero, the kernel would be a rank-1 subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$—for instance, if we project the first coordinate and reduce mod 2, we get a surjection with kernel $\\{(a,b) : a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\}$.\n\nThis kernel is isomorphic to $2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$. So regardless of whether $d_2$ vanishes, $E_3^{12,0} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nFor $E_3^{10,1}$, I need to apply the definition: it's the kernel of $d_2: E_2^{10,1} \\to E_2^{12,0}$ divided by the image of $d_2: E_2^{8,2} \\to E_2^{10,1}$.\n\nComputing $E_2^{8,2} = H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. The differential $d_2: E_2^{10,1} = \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to E_2^{8,2} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ is either zero or an isomorphism.\n\nIf nonzero, then $E_3^{10,1} = 0$. If it vanishes, then $E_3^{10,1} = \\mathbb{Z}/2 / \\text{Im}(d_2^{12,0})$. I need to determine whether this map is actually zero by examining $H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $H_8(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin})$ more carefully.\n\nThe differentials in this spectral sequence are determined by the Steenrod operations—specifically, $d_2$ acts like $Sq^2$ on the homology. For Spin bordism, these differentials arise naturally from the $k$-invariants of the $MSpin$ spectrum, so I should trace through how the Steenrod squares interact with the cohomology of $BG_2$.\n\nThe connection to connective real K-theory matters here: there's a ring map $MSpin \\to ko$ given by the $\\hat{A}$ genus, which becomes an equivalence after inverting 2. This tells me something about the structure of the Spin bordism groups. Looking at the actual bordism groups up to dimension 12, I see $\\Omega_0^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\Omega_1^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $\\Omega_2^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, $\\Omega_4^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}$, and the pattern continues from there.\n\nThe higher-dimensional groups follow: $\\Omega_8^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\\Omega_9^{Spin} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$, $\\Omega_{10}^{Spin} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$, and $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin} = \\mathbb{Z}^3$. The $d_2$ differentials in the AHSS connect these integer and torsion components. For the range I'm working with, assuming the spectral sequence collapses—which is reasonable given how sparse the homology and bordism groups typically are for classifying spaces of Lie groups—would give me $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\cong E_2^{4,8}$.\n\nCombining the relevant terms yields $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^5 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$. However, I need to be careful about extension problems—even when the spectral sequence collapses, the filtration quotients might not split cleanly, so the actual group structure could differ from this naive sum. The filtration on $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$ imposes constraints that could create non-trivial extensions between the graded pieces. Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}^5 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$ if the spectral sequence collapses cleanly without extension issues.\n\nHowever, extension problems could arise—for instance, the middle filtration quotient might not decompose as a direct sum of its graded pieces. Since most of the graded terms are free abelian groups like $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}$, extension problems tend to be manageable, though the torsion component $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ requires careful attention.\n\nThe key extension to check is $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to F_{12}/F_8 \\to \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to 0$, which splits because the quotient is free, giving $F_{12}/F_8 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$. All remaining extensions behave similarly, so the final answer should be $\\widetilde{\\\n\nOmega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nBut I need to verify that $d_2$ vanishes on the degree 12, 0 term. The element in $E_2^{12,0}$ corresponds to homology classes that can be represented by maps from 12-dimensional manifolds to $BG_2$. I should think about whether any differential could act nontrivially here.\n\nThe key constraint is that for a manifold to contribute to Spin bordism of $BG_2$, it must admit a Spin structure, which requires $w_2(M) = 0$. Since $G_2 \\subset Spin(7)$, any $G_2$-bundle automatically satisfies the necessary Stiefel-Whitney class conditions. The $d_2$ differential would measure obstructions related to the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the manifold itself, but this is already accounted for in the Spin bordism setup. bundle structure.\n\nThe AHSS differential $d_2$ is a natural transformation that determines whether classes in $H_n(BG_2)$ admit Spin representatives. Since $H_{12}(BG_2) = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and any 12-dimensional manifold can be chosen to be Spin through appropriate representative selection, the $d_2$ differential vanishes here. But actually, the convergence is to $\\Omega_*^{Spin}(BG_2)$, which parametrizes bordism classes of pairs $(M, f)$ with $M$ Spin and $f: M \\to BG_2$. The differential doesn't determine whether $M$ itself can be made Spin—it's already assumed to be.\n\nThe AHSS likely collapses for $BG_2$ due to sparseness, giving $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$. The rational part matches my earlier computation of $\\mathbb{Q}^5$, and the single $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ torsion comes from $E_\\infty^{10,2}$. I should verify where the torsion originates.\n\nThe potential non-trivial $d_2$ differential would be $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2$ from $E_2^{12,0}$ to $E_2^{10,1}$, which connects to the first $k$-invariant of $MSpin$ in its Postnikov tower. This $k$-invariant involves Steenrod operations like $Sq^3$, though determining whether it acts non-trivially on classes in $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ requires checking the specific cohomology structure.\n\nFor an element $\\alpha$ in that degree, the differential would apply $Sq^2$ on the mod 2 reduction, which dualizes the cohomology operation $Sq^2: H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$. The relevant cohomology classes are generated by products of Stiefel-Whitney classes like $w_4 w_6$ in degree 10, mapping to specific generators in degree 12.\n\nComputing $Sq^2(w_4 w_6)$ using the Cartan formula and known relations: $Sq^2 w_4 = w_6$ while $Sq^2 w_6$ vanishes by Adem relations, so the operation picks out the $w_4^3$ component in the target.\n\nThe dual map $d_2^*: H^{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H^{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ acts as $Sq^2$, sending $w_4 w_6 \\mapsto w_6^2 \\neq 0$. This shows $d_2$ is non-zero, and the map $d_2: H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_{10}(BG_\n\n2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ is dual to this Steenrod square operation. In homology, $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ generated by classes dual to $w_4^3$ and $w_6^2$, while $H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n\nThe induced map on homology sends the dual of $w_4^3$ to zero, since applying the Steenrod square to $w_4 w_6$ yields $w_6^2$, which pairs trivially with $w_4^3$. The dual of $w_6^2$ maps nontrivially under this operation.\n\nThis gives a surjection $Sq^2: H_{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H_{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/2)$ with kernel generated by the dual of $w_4^3$. The differential $d_2$ in the spectral sequence is the composition of reduction modulo 2 followed by the Steenrod square operation on the integral homology of $BG_2$.\n\nSince $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$ with generators including the integral lift of $c_4^3$, the map $d_2$ acts by first reducing modulo 2 and then applying $Sq^2$, which projects onto the $w_6^2$ component. The image of $c_4^3$ under this composition determines whether it survives to the $E_\\infty$ page.\n\nTo compute $d_2(c_4^3)$, I need to evaluate $Sq^2$ on the mod 2 reduction of $c_4^3$. Using the Cartan formula for $Sq^2(w_4 \\cdot w_4^2)$, this breaks into three terms: $w_4 Sq^2(w_4^2)$ from the first term, zero from the middle term since $Sq^1(w_4) = 0$, and a contribution from $w_6 w_4^2$ in the final term.\n\nFor $Sq^2(w_4^2)$, applying the formula gives $w_6 w_4 + w_4 w_6$, which vanishes in characteristic 2. This means $Sq^2(w_4^3) = w_4^2 w_6$, which has degree 14 rather than 12—confirming that the Steenrod square raises degree by 2 as expected.\n\nNow I need to reconsider the AHSS differentials. The $d_2$ map goes from $E_2^{n,0}$ to $E_2^{n-2,1}$, so for $n=12$ this is $d_2: E_2^{12,0} \\to E_2^{10,1}$. The source is $H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z})$ and the target involves $H_{10}(BG_2; \\Omega_1^{Spin})$.\n\nFor Spin bordism, the $d_2$ differential typically vanishes because the orientation map $MSpin \\to H\\mathbb{Z}$ extends to a spectrum map. Assuming $d_2 = 0$ simplifies the calculation, though this may need verification. If the differential is indeed trivial, then $E_\\infty^{4,8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nThe higher-degree terms follow: $E_\\infty^{8,4} = \\mathbb{Z}$, $E_\\infty^{10,2} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$, and $E_\\infty^{12,0} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$. This would give $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2$, but non-trivial differentials or extension problems could alter this result. I should double-check the torsion computation, particularly since $E_2^{10,2} = H_{10}(BG_2; \\Omega_2^{Spin}) = H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n}/2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. I need to verify whether any differentials $d_r: E_r^{10,2} \\to E_r^{10-r, 2+r-1}$ could be non-zero. The $d_2$ differential vanishes since $E_2^{8,3} = H_8(BG_2; 0) = 0$, and $d_3$ also vanishes because $E_3^{7,4} = H_7(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. I should continue checking higher differentials to see if any could affect the $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ term.\n\nThe $d_4$ differential maps to $E_4^{6,5} = H_6(BG_2; 0) = 0$, so it vanishes. Similarly, $d_5$ maps to $E_5^{5,6} = H_5(BG_2; 0) = 0$, which also vanishes. Since all outgoing differentials from $E_*^{10,2}$ are zero, I have $E_\\infty^{10,2} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. Now I need to check if any incoming differentials could affect this, particularly $d_2: E_2^{12,1} \\to E_2^{10,2}$ where $E_2^{12,1} = H_{12}(BG_2; \\Omega$...\n\n$_1^{Spin}) = H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$. This gives a potentially non-trivial map from $(\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ to $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. If this $d_2$ is surjective, then $E_3^{10,2}$ would be zero. The differential is related to a Steenrod operation—specifically, in the AHSS for $MSpin$, the $d_2: E_2^{*,1} \\to E_2^{*-2,2}$ comes from $Sq^2$.\n\nThe map $d_2: H_{12}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2) \\to H_{10}(BG_2; \\mathbb{Z}/2)$ takes the generators $w_4^3$ and $w_6^2$ (in homology) to $w_4 w_6$. Since $Sq^2$ on cohomology sends $w_4 w_6 \\mapsto w_6^2$, the dual map on homology is surjective, killing the $E_3$ term. , 1} = \\ker(d_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ (the $[w_4^3]^*$ component).\n\nThe $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ torsion from $E_2^{10, 2}$ gets eliminated. Now I need to track $E_3^{12, 1} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$. The differential $d_3: E_3^{12, 1} \\to E_3^{9, 3}$ vanishes since $E_3^{9, 3} = 0$, and there are no incoming differentials that could affect this class, so it survives to $E_\\infty$.\n\nHowever, this class contributes to degree $12 + 1 = 13$, not degree 12. I should double-check my indexing—the AHSS has total degree $p + q$, so for $\\Omega_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2)$ I need $p + q = 12$.\n\nThe relevant classes are $E_2^{12,0}$ and $E_2^{10,2}$, both with total degree 12. The differential $d_2$ has bidegree $(-2, 1)$, so it maps $E_2^{p,q} \\to E_2^{p-2, q+1}$, which preserves total degree minus 1. This means $d_2$ doesn't directly connect the degree-12 classes I'm tracking. d_2: E_2^{12, 1} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2)^2 \\to E_2^{10, 2} = \\mathbb{Z}/2$ is surjective by the Steenrod square computation, killing the element in $E_2^{10, 2}$ so $E_3^{10, 2} = 0$. The torsion I identified earlier gets eliminated by this differential. For total degree 12, I need to reconsider which classes survive to $E_\\infty$: $E_2^{4, 8} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $E_2^{8,\n\n4} = \\mathbb{Z}$ persist, while $E_2^{10, 2}$ vanishes, and $E_2^{12, 0} = \\mathbb{Z}^2$ remains. This gives $\\widetilde{\\Omega}_{12}^{Spin}(BG_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^5$.",
