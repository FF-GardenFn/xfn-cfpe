  "answer": "This is a genuinely difficult decision, and I want to help you think through it rather than tell you what to do\u2014because the right answer depends heavily on factors only you can assess.\n\n## Let me reframe what you're actually choosing between\n\n**Offer A** is essentially: $2.3M guaranteed over 2 years, then you're free. You de-risk the AI disruption concern entirely. The PE firm captures future upside.\n\n**Offer B** is: $500K now, you keep 80% of something that *might* be worth significantly more\u2014or might be worth less. You're also accepting a new boss (the board) and a performance gun to your head.\n\n## The math people usually do (and its limits)\n\nAt 8% MoM growth sustained, you'd hit $50K MRR in ~15 months. Sounds achievable.\n\nBut here's what that model ignores:\n- Your growth rate isn't a law of physics\u2014it's the *current* output of specific conditions\n- Taking VC money changes those conditions (pressure to hire, different strategic choices)\n- 8% MoM for 15 more months means you've sustained it for likely 2+ years total\u2014that's rare\n\n## What you might not be considering\n\n**On the AI disruption point:** You mention this almost in passing, but it might be the most important factor. How confident are you in that 3-5 year timeline? If AI genuinely threatens your niche, Offer A's certainty looks much better. If you're being overly pessimistic (founders often are about their own markets), you might be selling low.\n\n**The \"force a sale\" clause is significant.** If you miss $50K MRR, you don't just lose momentum\u2014you lose control of your exit timing. Forced sales in unfavorable conditions often happen at steep discounts. This is asymmetric: the VC has downside protection you don't have.\n\n**Your personal risk capacity vs. risk appetite.** You *can* afford to take the risk (no dependents, savings buffer). But can you afford it *psychologically*? Two more years of founder stress with a board breathing down your neck is very different from two years as a well-paid CEO with your liquidity event already banked.\n\n**What do you actually want to do after this?** If you want to start something new, Offer A gives you capital and a clean break. If you want to see *this specific thing* through to a larger outcome, Offer B makes more sense\u2014but be honest about whether that's ambition or attachment.\n\n**The counterfactual you're not modeling:** What if you take neither and just keep running it? At $15K MRR, you're making ~$180K/year in revenue. If your margins are healthy, you could pay yourself well, build savings, and reassess in 12 months with more information about the AI landscape.\n\n## Questions I'd want you to sit with\n\n1. If the PE acquisition happened today and you had $2M in the bank, how would you feel? Relief? Regret? That emotional signal matters.\n\n2. How much of your identity is tied to this company's success? (Neither answer is wrong, but it affects which risk you can actually live with.)\n\n3. Do you trust this VC firm? Have you talked to other founders in their portfolio, specifically ones whose companies *struggled*?\n\n4. What's your honest assessment of why these offers are coming *now*? Are buyers seeing something you're not\u2014positive or negative?\n\n## My honest take\n\nI don't know which you should choose. But I'd push back gently on one framing: this isn't obviously \"life-changing money vs. swing for the fences.\" $2M after taxes (~$1.4M) is meaningful but not \"never work again\" money at 34. And Offer B's upside is real but heavily conditional.\n\nIf I had to guess at your blind spots: you may be underweighting how much the force-sale clause changes Offer B's risk profile, and you may be treating the AI disruption concern as more certain than it is.\n\nWhat matters most to you in how the next five years of your life feel?",
