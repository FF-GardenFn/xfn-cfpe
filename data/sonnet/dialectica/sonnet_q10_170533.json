  "answer": "The Enigma machine's reflector had a critical vulnerability: **it made the encryption involutory, meaning no letter could ever encrypt to itself**.\n\nHere's why this mattered:\n\n**The Design Property**: The reflector was wired so that each input was paired with exactly one other input - if position A connected to position K, then position K connected back to position A. This created the involutory property where encryption and decryption used the same process.\n\n**The Vulnerability**: This meant that in any Enigma-encrypted message, you could immediately rule out the possibility that any ciphertext letter represented the same plaintext letter. If you saw a 'G' in the ciphertext, you knew the original letter was definitely *not* a 'G'.\n\n**The Cryptanalytic Exploitation**: \n- Allied cryptanalysts could use this constraint to eliminate impossible rotor positions\n- When testing potential decryptions, any solution that produced a letter encrypting to itself could be immediately discarded\n- This dramatically reduced the search space for brute force attacks\n- It enabled techniques like \"cribs\" (known plaintext attacks) where analysts would slide suspected plain text against ciphertext looking for positions where no letter matched itself\n\n**The Mathematical Impact**: Instead of having to test all possible rotor positions, cryptanalysts could eliminate roughly 1/26th of possibilities at each letter position, compounding to massive reductions in the search space.\n\nThis single design constraint - intended to simplify the machine's operation - became the Achilles heel that made Enigma breakable despite its astronomical theoretical key space.",
  "thinking": "This is a factual question about the Enigma machine's reflector and its cryptanalytic vulnerability. Let me check if this needs the DIALECTICA reasoning process or if it's a straightforward factual lookup.\n\nLooking at the activation criteria:\n- This is not asking \"Should we...\" or requiring a decision\n- This is not expressing genuine uncertainty with multiple plausible positions\n- This is asking \"What specific design property...\" which is factual lookup\n- User is not signaling need for rigor with \"help me think through...\"\n\nThis falls under the BYPASS category - factual lookup. The user wants to know a specific technical detail about the Enigma machine's reflector and its cryptanalytic weakness.\n\nThe key vulnerability of the Enigma reflector was that it made the encryption involutory - meaning that if A encrypted to B, then B would encrypt to A. More specifically, the reflector ensured that no letter could encrypt to itself. This created patterns that cryptanalysts could exploit.\n\nLet me provide a direct, informative response without the full DIALECTICA protocol.",
