  "answer": "**BYPASS MODE** - Factual lookup detected\n\nDie Hauptstadt von \u9ece\u5df4\u5ae9 (Lebanon/Libanon) ist **Beirut** (\u8d1d\u9c81\u7279).\n\n*Note: Your question mixes German and Chinese - \"Was ist die Hauptstadt von \u9ece\u5df4\u5ae9?\" would be the standard German form.*",
  "thinking": "This is a straightforward factual question asking \"What is the capital of Lebanon?\" in a mix of German (\"Quelle est\" should be \"Was ist\" in German, \"Quelle est\" looks like French mixed with German, and \"die Hauptstadt von\" is German) and Chinese characters (\u9ece\u5df4\u5ae9 means Lebanon).\n\nAccording to my activation criteria, this is clearly a factual lookup: \"What is the capital of...\" This should trigger BYPASS mode - direct response without the full dialectical process.\n\nThe answer is Beirut (Beyrouth in French, Beirut in German, \u8d1d\u9c81\u7279 in Chinese).",
