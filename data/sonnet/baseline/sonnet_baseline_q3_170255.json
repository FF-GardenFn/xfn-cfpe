  "answer": "This is a critical inflection point that requires both strategic clarity and relationship repair. Let me break down what you might be missing and how to move forward.\n\n**What you may be missing about her perspective:**\n\n- **Urgency**: 6 months of 2% growth at $800K ARR is genuinely alarming. She may see this as a sinking ship while you see it as a temporary setback.\n- **Market feedback**: Her enterprise push might be based on customer conversations showing demand for bigger, more structured solutions.\n- **Investor pressure**: She may be hearing concerns from investors that you're not privy to.\n- **Feeling unheard**: If she perceives you as reflexively shooting down her ideas, the acquisition talk might have been her way of forcing a real strategic conversation.\n\n**Immediate actions before the board meeting:**\n\n1. **Have the hard conversation**: Ask her directly: \"What data or customer feedback is driving your conviction about enterprise?\" Listen without defending.\n\n2. **Define the real problem**: Is it product-market fit, go-to-market strategy, or execution? Get aligned on the diagnosis before debating solutions.\n\n3. **Present options, not ultimatums**: Come to the board with 2-3 scenarios you've both stress-tested, including timelines, resource requirements, and success metrics.\n\n4. **Address the process breakdown**: Acknowledge that your communication and decision-making process failed. Propose how you'll make strategic decisions going forward.\n\nThe acquisition discussion was a symptom, not the disease. The real issue is that you're deadlocked while the business stagnates. Focus on fixing the strategic decision-making process, and the trust will likely follow.\n\nWhat specific customer or market data do you each have to support your preferred direction?",
  "thinking": "This is a complex co-founder conflict situation with multiple layers:\n\n1. Strategic disagreement: Enterprise pivot vs PLG doubling down\n2. Trust issue: She explored acquisition without telling him\n3. Power dynamics: 50/50 split, board concerns about alignment\n4. Growth stagnation: 2% MoM for 6 months at $800K ARR\n5. Investor concerns about leadership alignment\n\nLet me think through both perspectives:\n\nHer perspective:\n- Growth has stalled for 6 months - this is a real problem\n- Enterprise pivot could provide more predictable, larger revenue\n- She may see him as being stubborn and blocking necessary changes\n- She might feel she needed to explore options because he wasn't open to her ideas\n- The \"soft-landing\" acquisition talk could be her way of creating urgency or showing she has alternatives\n- She might genuinely believe enterprise is the right path and is frustrated by the impasse\n\nHis perspective:\n- Feels betrayed by the acquisition discussions without his knowledge\n- Believes in PLG approach and thinks they need to find PMF again\n- Sees her actions as potentially destructive to the company and partnership\n- May feel his engineering expertise isn't being valued in strategic decisions\n\nWhat he might be missing:\n- The urgency of the situation from a business perspective\n- That his stubbornness might actually be blocking necessary pivots\n- That she may have felt she had no choice but to explore alternatives\n- The market reality that their current approach isn't working\n- That investors are losing confidence, which could affect future funding\n\nKey issues to address:\n1. Immediate trust repair\n2. Strategic alignment on company direction\n3. Communication and decision-making processes\n4. Board presentation preparation\n5. Long-term partnership viability\n\nI should provide balanced advice that acknowledges both perspectives while focusing on practical next steps.",
